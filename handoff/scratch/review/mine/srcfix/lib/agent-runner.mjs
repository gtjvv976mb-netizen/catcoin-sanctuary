/**
 * THE AGENT RUNNER: SNAPSHOT → PROTECTIONS → (ON SCHEDULE) THE MODEL → THE LIMITS → EXECUTE → JOURNAL.
 *
 * CoinMarketCat's agent, run by the service worker on its half-minute alarm. Each tick:
 *
 *   1. SNAPSHOT. One DexScreener read prices every token in the universe (and every token
 *      still held); when the model is due, fifteen-minute candles too (agent-market.mjs).
 *   2. PROTECTIONS, every tick, whether or not the model is due, reachable or paid for:
 *      the stop loss, the take profit and the daily drawdown breaker (agent-risk.mjs). An
 *      exit they order is executed before anything else. They run while the agent is paused
 *      and after it is stopped, for as long as it holds anything.
 *   3. THE MODEL, only while running and only when its schedule (15, 30 or 60 minutes) comes
 *      round: the owner's strategy, the snapshot, the vault, the positions and the recent
 *      decisions go to agent-brain.mjs; a proposal comes back, or a failure, which means no
 *      new entries this tick and nothing else.
 *   4. THE LIMITS: planOrders turns the proposal into clamped orders and named refusals.
 *   5. EXECUTE, sells first. PAPER — the default — fills at Jupiter's quote (the quote's
 *      expected output; a real fill can come in lower, down to the slippage floor) and
 *      signs nothing. LIVE asks Jupiter for the transaction and runs the same check before
 *      signing the xStock venue runs (xstock-lane.mjs checkBeforeSigning): the pair must be
 *      the settlement token and a listed token (`allowedPairs`, inside checkSwapTransaction),
 *      the route direct or ONE hop through SOL held in Jupiter's own account (see swap()),
 *      the lookup tables resolved on the owner's RPC, the wallet's other token accounts
 *      untouched, the engine's simulate guard, the exact input, no wrapped SOL left in the
 *      wallet, its SOL moved by the fee and rent alone, and both accounts safe after
 *      the simulation; only then the engine's signSendConfirm, fixed to the AUTOPILOT WALLET
 *      (engine.mjs agentFences) — the key signs without a window, as it does for the sniper
 *      lane. The fill is read back from the confirmed transaction.
 *   6. JOURNAL every decision with its rationale, every refusal with its clause, every fill
 *      (with its signature when live), the breaker, the controls and the token usage, capped
 *      at JOURNAL_MAX entries in chrome.storage.local.
 *
 * WHEN THE WORKER DIES MID-TICK (Chrome closed, the machine asleep). The book is written after
 * every fill and the model's turn before it is asked, not only at the end of a tick; a live
 * swap is written down as in flight before the key signs it, and a worker that wakes to find
 * a buy in flight pauses the agent and says so. A live buy that was sent and whose outcome
 * cannot be read pauses it too: it may have landed as tokens this book does not hold.
 *
 * THE OWNER'S MONEY IN AND OUT is not a gain or a loss: a deposit or a withdrawal of the
 * settlement token (a read no fill explains) and a position withdrawn or moved by hand move
 * the UTC day's starting value and the peak with them (`settledAt`, `externalFlow`), so the
 * breaker judges trading only. While the owner's withdrawal sweeps the wallet the ticks stand
 * aside. Pause, stop, liquidate and withdraw stop new buys from the moment they are asked,
 * even by a tick already waiting on the model; Liquidate all keeps selling, tick after tick,
 * what it could not sell at once.
 *
 * WHAT THE MODEL CANNOT REACH. It proposes buy, sell or hold for a listed token; nothing it
 * returns is read as a limit, and nothing here writes the spec but `saveSpec`, which only
 * the owner's pages call. The WITHDRAWAL is not in this file at all: the worker sweeps the
 * autopilot wallet to the connected Phantom address (the autopilot wallet's existing sweep)
 * when the owner asks from the popup, and then tells this runner which
 * positions left (`markWithdrawn`). There is no code path from a decision to a sweep.
 *
 * THE KEY. This file never sees the owner's API key (the worker hands the brain a reader)
 * and never holds a signing key (it reaches a signature only through the engine's fences).
 * Everything else — the clock, storage, the market, the brain, Jupiter, the fences — is
 * injected, so test-agent-runner.mjs runs it end to end with no network.
