/**
 * HAWK-AI IN THE BROWSER: THE LANE.
 *
 * This is executor/snipe-lane.mjs's job done where the wallet is Phantom instead of a
 * burner key. The decision code is the executor's own, imported: `snipeContract` decides
 * whether a launch may be bought and at what ceiling; `snipePolicy` decides when a
 * position leaves; `buyIx` / `sellIx` encode the bytes; `curveExitMarkX` prices what is
 * held; `createSnipeShadow` keeps the research book in the executor's own row schema, so
 * `node vendor/executor/grade-entry-gates.mjs --file <export>` grades this lane's rows exactly as it
 * grades WALL-ST-E's. What this file owns is the plumbing around a signer that is a
 * person, and one entry rule the record supports:
 *
 *   · TWO SIGNERS, ONE SHAPE. `bridge` is Phantom: one approval window per trade, by
 *     design — Phantom has no auto-approve and this lane does not route around it; in
 *     that mode the extension never sees a key. `sessionSigner` is the AUTOPILOT WALLET
 *     (the session wallet module, which only the background host imports): the same
 *     { isReady(), wallet(), signTransaction() } shape, answered by a key the extension
 *     generated, keeps encrypted, and unlocks for a while — no window. `config.signerMode`
 *     picks which one BUYS; a SELL is always signed by whichever of the two holds the
 *     position, so switching modes never strands one. On autopilot the budget is also the
 *     balance: a buy the autopilot wallet cannot cover (ticket, fee, rent, one sell's fee
 *     and the rent floor) is refused before anything is signed. This file never touches a
 *     key either way; test-hawk-no-key.mjs scans it on every run.
 *
 *   · WATCH FIRST, THEN BUY. Every launch is evaluated at first notice exactly as the
 *     executor evaluates it — same contract, same ceiling — and opens a WOULD-HAVE
 *     position in the book, sampled forward for the shadow book. In an armed lane, that
 *     would-have position is the watch: only once it is `entryWaitMs` old AND still marks
 *     at or above `entryFollowThroughX` of its own would-have fill does the lane re-read
 *     the curve, run the contract again with the instruction it will sign, and ask
 *     Phantom. The record behind that: entries under three seconds won 0 of 9 and
 *     averaged −18.5%, entries past ten seconds won 4 of 10 and averaged +34%, and the
 *     shadow book's positive class — a launch nobody followed — is exactly a curve whose
 *     mark fell below the would-have fill. NONE OF THAT IS EVIDENCE OF AN EDGE; ρ for
 *     seconds-late was +0.08 at n=64. It is a rule that keeps this lane out of the one
 *     bucket that never won, and the shadow book grades it on every row.
 *
 *   · A BUY THAT WAITS TOO LONG IS NOT A BUY. A Phantom window that sits past
 *     `approvalTimeoutMs` is abandoned and the mint is marked attempted.
 *
 *   · A SELL THAT IS DECLINED IS ASKED AGAIN. The determiner re-fires on every tick; the
 *     lane asks Phantom again after `sellReaskMs`, and says so through `notify`. A stop
 *     that needs a click is a weaker stop than a key's, and the console says that.
 *
 *   · EVERYTHING IS DEPENDENCY-INJECTED — `rpc`, `bridge`, `store`, `clock`, `timers`,
 *     `fetchImpl` — so the whole lane runs in Node against a scripted chain and a
 *     scripted wallet (test-hawk-engine.mjs), and the service worker is a thin host.
 *
 *   · A LAUNCH QUOTED IN A STOCK (pump.fun "Custom Pairs": a curve priced in an xStock
 *     such as GLDx) is refused exactly as before unless the user listed that stock in
 *     `config.quoteMints`. A listed stock's mint account rides on the SAME
 *     getMultipleAccounts as the curve; `describeMint` reads its token program, decimals
 *     and pause switch (never `auditMintAccount`, which rightly refuses an xStock as a
 *     BASE mint), and the contract gets those facts as `quote`, with the ticket, day cap
 *     and minimum in the stock's raw units. The quote-token accounting is this file's:
 *     the quote ATA under the mint's own program on both legs, a simulate guard on that
 *     ATA's delta, a fill read from token balances in the stock's decimals, a day ledger
 *     per stock, and book rows that say what they were paid in. The first live buy in
 *     each stock is a CANARY at that stock's minPerTrade until one stock fill has been
 *     read back off the chain (config.mjs STOCK_CANARY_RULE), and the popup says so.
 *
 *   · A SECOND VENUE, OFF BY DEFAULT: new pools anywhere on Solana that pair a token with
 *     an xStock, found on public new-pool feeds and traded through Jupiter
 *     (src/lib/xstock-lane.mjs). It is built here and handed this file's own pieces — the
 *     clock, the day ledger, the signers, `simulateGuard`, `signSendConfirm` and the fill
 *     reader — so a Jupiter trade passes the same fences a pump.fun one does. It keeps its
 *     own book (S.xstock.snipes), ticks on its own loop so a slow Jupiter answer never
 *     delays a pump.fun sell, and shares with this lane the one-window-at-a-time slot, the
 *     live-position count and every day cap. With it off, nothing below behaves differently.
 *
 * Raw amounts are carried as digit strings everywhere they are stored, because the
 * snipe book refuses a BigInt (JSON.stringify throws on it) — see snipe-book.mjs.
