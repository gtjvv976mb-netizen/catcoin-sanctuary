/**
 * CASHCAT, IN YOUR BROWSER: DRAFTING A CAT COIN OF YOUR OWN, AND EVERY WAY A DRAFT IS REFUSED.
 *
 * Two ways to a draft, one set of rules:
 *
 *   · YOU TYPE IT: a name, a ticker, one line, the topic it riffs on, and (optionally) the kitten
 *     and the background of its logo.
 *   · CASHCAT DRAFTS IT FROM A TREND: bots/cashcat/trends.mjs reads what is trending (Google
 *     Trends' US feed and CoinGecko's trending categories, each topic through checkTrend first),
 *     and bots/cashcat/invent.mjs asks the model, through YOUR Anthropic key (the agent's brain,
 *     which alone holds it) and the model picked at run time from GET /v1/models, to propose one
 *     coin and then, as a separate reviewer, to refuse anything that breaks the rules.
 *
 * Every draft, either way, passes the bots' own rules before it can be launched:
 *   checkTrend (the topic: people by the long given-name list, brands, tragedy, minors, sex, hate,
 *   politics, links), checkProposal (the name, ticker and line), the Jupiter verified-token and
 *   established-cat-coin ticker check (bots/cashcat/tickers.mjs), the site's own record validator,
 *   and — whenever an API key is saved — the model review (REVIEW_TOOL). A trend draft needs the
 *   key; a draft you type is reviewed by the model when a key is saved and by the rules alone when
 *   none is. Any refusal is named. No model identifier is written here or anywhere in the repository.
 *
 * Everything is injected (the http client, the model adapter, the clock); this file touches no
 * chrome.* API and holds no key.
