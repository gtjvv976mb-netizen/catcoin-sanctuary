# Cat Intelligence Agency

*Every agent is a cat built for crypto.*

**Website:** [catintelligenceagency.com](https://catintelligenceagency.com/)

Cat Intelligence Agency is a crew of seven pixel kittens built for crypto, plus the agency's
memecoin, **$CIA**. The software cats come in **one download: the Cat Intelligence Agency
extension**, a Chrome extension you run in your own browser against your own wallet, with five
cats inside ([below](#the-cat-intelligence-agency-extension--five-cats-one-download)):
**CoinMarketCat**, the agentic trading cat — agentic trading for Solana, in plain English;
**Snipurr**, the pump.fun sniper cat; **Popcat**, which checks new cat coins on pump.fun;
**CashCat**, which launches a cat coin of your own; and **Crying Cat**, a rug check for any mint.
The agency also runs its own **CashCat** and **Popcat** as bots on this repository's GitHub
Actions, posting only on the website, dry until the owner switches them on
([below](#cashcat-and-popcat--the-agencys-bots)). Crying Cat and Grumpy Cat are also characters
the agency posts as on X. This repository holds all of it. CoinMarketCat is not affiliated with
CoinMarketCap.

| Agent | Beat | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **The Director** | Runs the agency | The mascot |
| **CoinMarketCat** | Agentic trading for Solana, in plain English | **Software: a cat in the Cat Intelligence Agency extension** ([manual below](#coinmarketcat--the-agentic-trading-cat)). An orange tabby pixel kitten in a purple hoodie |
| **Snipurr** | New pump.fun launches, sniped by rule | Software: the sniper lane in the extension ([manual below](#snipurr--the-sniper-lane)). It posts nothing on X. The mint-green kitten with the sniper-scope eyepiece, CoinMarketCat's old art |
| **Crying Cat** | Ruggers | A persona the agency posts as on X, and the face of $CIA; in the extension, a rug check for any mint ([below](#crying-cat-in-the-extension--a-rug-check-for-any-mint)) |
| **Grumpy Cat** | Fake hype | A persona the agency posts as on X. Not in the extension: telling real hype from fake needs social data it does not have |
| **CashCat** | Launches cat-themed coins by itself, from what is trending, on pump.fun and on StonkFun (Solana's stock-paired launchpad) | **A bot in this repository** (`bots/cashcat/`, [below](#cashcat-and-popcat--the-agencys-bots)), dry until switched on; nothing has launched. In the extension, it launches a cat coin of your own on pump.fun ([below](#cashcat-in-the-extension--launch-a-cat-coin-of-your-own)). It no longer investigates whales and KOLs |
| **Popcat** | Checks every new cat coin on pump.fun and lists it at its desk on the work floor with its safety checks: a callout when none finds a red flag, spotted with its red flags named when one does. Every six hours it picks at most one callout for the agency to post by hand on pump.fun. Cat coins only | **A bot in this repository** (`bots/popcat/`), dry until switched on; nothing has been listed or picked. In the extension, the same checks on new cat coins, for you ([below](#popcat-in-the-extension--the-cat-coin-scanner)) |

## What is in this repository

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/`, `manifest.json`, `build.mjs`, `vendor/`, `fixtures/` | The Cat Intelligence Agency extension: CoinMarketCat, Snipurr, Popcat, CashCat and Crying Cat |
| `bots/`, `.github/workflows/cashcat.yml`, `.github/workflows/popcat.yml` | CashCat and Popcat, the agency's two bots, and the workflows that run them |
| `site/` | The website: the agency's home with its 3D headquarters, [the work floor](https://catintelligenceagency.com/floor/) where the cats post their cases, [CoinMarketCat's page](https://catintelligenceagency.com/coinmarketcat/), and [the console](https://catintelligenceagency.com/console/) the extension signs through |
| `brand/` | The [brand kit](brand/README.md): the seven pixel kittens (CoinMarketCat in its purple hoodie, Snipurr in CoinMarketCat's old art), the work floor with seven desks, the X header, the $CIA coin image, the 3D headquarters model, and [the launch copy](brand/COPY.md) |
| `icons/` | The extension's icons (`cia-*.png`: Crying Cat's face from the $CIA coin, the agency's mark) and CoinMarketCat's own (`coinmarketcat-*.png`, its hoodie tabby, for its page on the site) |

$CIA is a memecoin with no intrinsic value and no expectation of profit. Nothing here is
financial advice. Cat Intelligence Agency is a meme and software project, not a government
agency, and is not affiliated with CoinMarketCap or with the owners of any real cat or meme.

## The work floor, and how to post a case

Click the 3D headquarters on the home page (or **Enter the agency**, or **The Floor** in the
bar) and you are on [the work floor](https://catintelligenceagency.com/floor/): the office in
pixel art, each of the seven cats at its own desk. Click a desk to open that cat's station: its monitor,
who it is, and **its case files**, newest first — or, for the two bots, CashCat's launches and
every cat coin Popcat checked, under Popcat's pick. Every case, launch and callout, and
Popcat's latest pick, also shows up under **Latest from the floor** (the coins Popcat spotted
with red flags stay at its desk). Until a cat has posted something, its station says so and shows its template instead.
Nothing on the floor is invented: it shows only what is in three files, `cases.json`, which you
edit by hand as below, and `launches.json` and `callouts.json`, which only the bots write
([below](#where-the-data-lives-and-how-it-reaches-the-site)).

**Posting a case** (after the thread is up on X, written from the templates in
[brand/COPY.md](brand/COPY.md)):

1. Open `site/assets/cases.json` and add one entry at the end of `"cases"`.
2. In `test-site.mjs`, raise `POSTED_CASES` by one. The test pins the count, so a case can
   only reach the site on purpose.
3. Run `node test-site.mjs`. It runs the same check the page runs and names any entry it
   would refuse.
4. Commit and push to `main`. Pages redeploys, and the case is on its cat's desk, at the top
   of the feed, and linkable as `https://catintelligenceagency.com/floor/#CRY-001`.

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `id` | The agent's prefix and a number: `DIR-001` (the Director), `CRY-001` (Crying Cat), `GRR-001` (Grumpy Cat), `CMC-001` (CoinMarketCat's field reports), `SNP-001` (Snipurr's field reports). Unique. |
| `agent` | `director`, `crying-cat`, `grumpy-cat`, `coinmarketcat` or `snipurr` |
| `date` | The day it was posted, UTC, `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `verdict` | One of that agent's verdicts (below) |
| `title` | One line, up to 140 characters. Plain text. |
| `summary` | A few sentences, up to 700 characters. Plain text. |
| `evidence` | A list of links, each `{ "label": "...", ... }` with exactly one of `"tx"` (a transaction signature, linked on Solscan), `"address"` (a wallet or mint, linked on Solscan) or `"url"` (any `https://` page; an archived copy for anything off-chain). At least one, except for the Director's announcements: no link, no case. Up to 12. |
| `x` | Optional: the post on X, `https://x.com/<handle>/status/<id>`. It shows as **Read on X**. |

| Agent | Verdicts |
|---|---|
| The Director | `ANNOUNCEMENT`, `CORRECTION` |
| Crying Cat | `RUGGED`, `NO RED FLAGS FOUND`, `CORRECTED` |
| Grumpy Cat | `NOT IMPRESSED`, `NO RED FLAGS FOUND`, `CORRECTED` |
| CoinMarketCat | `FIELD REPORT` |
| Snipurr | `FIELD REPORT` |

CashCat and Popcat post no cases: the file refuses a case filed under either. What they post
is written by the bots themselves to `launches.json` and `callouts.json`. A launch or a
callout the agency got wrong is corrected by the Director, like any case.

A worked example: a Crying Cat case, as it would sit in the file. Every `[bracketed]` value
is a slot to fill from the case's own thread; the validator refuses the entry until the date,
the signatures and the addresses are real, so a half-filled copy can never reach the page.

```json
{
  "cases": [
    {
      "id": "CRY-001",
      "agent": "crying-cat",
      "date": "[YYYY-MM-DD]",
      "verdict": "RUGGED",
      "title": "[Token name] ($[TICKER]): the pool's creator pulled the liquidity [n] minutes in",
      "summary": "[One or two sentences: what the wallets did, in order, in plain words.] Our opinion on public on-chain data, not an accusation of a crime.",
      "evidence": [
        { "label": "Launch", "tx": "[transaction signature]" },
        { "label": "Liquidity removed", "tx": "[transaction signature]" },
        { "label": "Deployer", "address": "[wallet address]" },
        { "label": "Funds went to", "address": "[wallet address]" },
        { "label": "Archived token page", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/[...]" }
      ],
      "x": "https://x.com/[handle]/status/[post id]"
    }
  ]
}
```

**A correction** goes out as loud as the case: add a `DIR-` entry with the verdict
`CORRECTION` that names the case in its title, and set the original case's verdict to
`CORRECTED`, saying in its summary what changed. The original stays up.

**If something is wrong in the file**, the floor never breaks: an entry that fails a rule
(an unknown agent, a date that is not a real day, a link that is not `http(s)`, anything that
looks like HTML, a misspelt field) is skipped and named in the browser console, and a file
that is not valid JSON leaves every station working with a note that the case files could
not be read. `node test-site.mjs` catches both before they ship. The rules live in
`site/assets/cases.js`, which the page and the test share.

## CashCat and Popcat — the agency's bots

Two bots run on this repository's GitHub Actions. **CashCat** launches cat-themed coins of its
own, from what is trending, on pump.fun and on StonkFun. **Popcat** reads every new pump.fun
coin, keeps the cat ones, runs twelve on-chain safety checks on each and lists **every** cat coin
it checked: a **callout** when no check found a red flag, **spotted** with its red flags named in
plain words when one did. Every six hours it also makes at most one **pick**, a callout with a
short draft that the owner may post **by hand** as a callout on pump.fun, where callers are paid
(below: pump.fun's terms forbid a bot to post it). Both are **dry by default**: until the owner
switches one on, it does everything up to the point of sending or publishing, prints what it
would have done, and changes nothing. What they post appears only on the website: CashCat's
launches at its desk on [the work floor](https://catintelligenceagency.com/floor/#cashcat),
every coin Popcat checked and its pick at [its desk](https://catintelligenceagency.com/floor/#popcat),
and the launches, the callouts and the pick in **Latest from the floor**. Neither posts on X,
Telegram or pump.fun.

### What CashCat does, once per run

1. Counts today's launches (UTC) in `launches.json` and on chain, reading every transaction
   on its wallet since the start of yesterday that the file does not already record, and stops
   at the day's cap (two by default, never more than six). A launch that is on chain but not in
   the file stops it until someone records it, even one sent by yesterday's last run. If the
   wallet holds more unrecorded transactions than it will read (60 since yesterday: dust and
   airdrops sent to it count), or the RPC cannot return one, it does not launch.
2. Claims its pump.fun creator fees when the creator vault holds at least 0.01 SOL (live only,
   and only when `CASHCAT_WALLET_ADDRESS` names the wallet it holds and its own RPC is set).
3. Picks the venue in turn (`pumpfun`, then `stonkfun`), and for StonkFun reads the pair, the
   pricing and the LaunchLab accounts from StonkFun's developer API and checks them against
   the chain.
4. Reads what is trending: Google Trends' trending-searches RSS (US) and CoinGecko's trending
   categories. Every trend passes a fixed content filter first.
5. Asks a model (picked at run time from `GET /v1/models`: `CASHCAT_MODEL` when set, which
   must be one the key lists, else the first listed) to invent one cat coin for one trend (name, ticker, one line,
   which of eight kittens holds the sign, the background colour), then asks it again, as a
   reviewer, to refuse anything that breaks the rules. The same rules are also enforced by
   code that does not depend on the model: no real people, brands or trademarks, no claimed
   endorsement or anything official, no disasters, deaths, violence or tragedies, nothing
   about minors, nothing sexual or hateful, no politics, no promise of gains, no ticker or
   name that a token on Jupiter's verified list already uses, no copy of an established
   cat coin, and no web address. The words are read the way a person would see them:
   look-alike letters from other alphabets, invisible characters inside a word and letters
   spelt out one by one are all caught, and its name and line use the Latin alphabet only.
   The coin's record must also pass the site's own validator before anything is uploaded or
   signed, so a launch that lands can always be listed. If Jupiter's list cannot be read,
   there is no coin. Two tries, then no coin this run.
6. Draws the logo: one of eight kitten pictures holding a sign, the ticker on the sign in
   Press Start 2P (SIL Open Font License, in `bots/cashcat/art/font/`), on the chosen colour.
7. Builds the launch transaction (pump.fun `create_v2`, or LaunchLab's
   `initialize_with_token_2022` for StonkFun), checks it before any signature (exactly the
   planned fee payer, signers, programs, accounts, flags and decoded arguments, at most two
   compute-budget instructions), and simulates it. **A dry run stops here.**
8. Live only, when every guard is green: pins the logo and the metadata on IPFS through
   Pinata and reads them back, rebuilds with the real URI, checks and simulates again, signs
   with its own wallet, sends, confirms, reads the launch back from the chain (it landed,
   CashCat paid for it, the mint exists with no mint or freeze authority left, and what it
   cost), makes the dev buy if one is set, and appends the launch to `launches.json`.

Every coin's description says: *Launched automatically by CashCat, a bot of the Cat
Intelligence Agency (catintelligenceagency.com). A cat-themed riff on a trending topic
("…"); not affiliated with, endorsed by or connected to that topic or anyone in it. Not
financial advice. No roadmap, no team, no promises: most coins like this go nowhere.*

**The rules it cannot break** (each one is a test): it launches only from its own wallet,
whose secret comes only from the `CASHCAT_WALLET_SECRET` secret, and that key is never
written to disk, printed or committed. It launches for real only when `CASHCAT_LIVE` is `1`.
The dev buy is 0 by default, at most 0.05 SOL, pump.fun only, and shown with the launch. It
never buys or sells its coins from any other wallet: no bundles, no hidden wallets, no volume
bots, no sniping its own launch. After a launch the only thing it does is claim pump.fun
creator fees. A dry run never appears on the website.

### What Popcat does, once per run

**What changed (September 2026).** Popcat used to publish only the coins that passed all twelve
checks, and looked only at coins between 15 and about 40 minutes old, so a late or skipped run
lost coins. Now it lists every cat coin it can check, flagged or not, keeps a queue so that no
cat coin is missed between runs, runs every fifteen minutes instead of every thirty, and makes
Popcat's pick.

1. Reads pump.fun's newest coins back to where its last complete listing began (`listedTo` in its
   memory, with five minutes of overlap), and its recently traded coins. pump.fun lists only its
   newest 1,050 coins (it answered offsets 0 to 1,000 and an empty list past that on 2026-09-25):
   about forty minutes of launches at the rate seen that night. Hence the fifteen-minute schedule:
   one skipped run still leaves the next inside the listing. When runs are late or skipped for
   longer than the listing reaches, the run says so in its log and its summary (`MISSED: …`,
   with the stretch of creation times it could not list); nothing is passed over quietly.
2. Keeps the cat coins: a cat word in the name, the ticker or (with a model to confirm) the
   description, matched on word boundaries with guards against false friends (*catch*,
   *category*, *scat*, *muscat*…). With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, a model confirms each coin is
   cat-themed and fit to print by name and ticker; without it, coins that are cats only by
   their description are skipped. The name and ticker must also pass the same content filter
   CashCat's coins do, since the site prints them; a name or ticker carrying a web address is
   never printed, and the run counts it as skipped.
3. Drops CashCat's coins (by its wallet, `CASHCAT_WALLET_ADDRESS`, and by every mint and
   wallet in `launches.json`; the creator is taken both from pump.fun's listing and from the
   coin's bonding curve on chain), and queues every other cat coin it has not dealt with, at any
   age under a day, in `popcat-state.json`. A coin younger than 15 minutes waits in the queue, so
   that its holders mean something when it is checked.
4. Checks the queue, oldest coin first, at most 30 coins a run (`RUN_LIMITS.maxChecksPerRun` in
   `bots/popcat/callout.mjs`): about a dozen RPC reads and two pump.fun reads a coin, paced within
   the limits `bots/lib/http.mjs` already keeps. Coins over the budget wait for the next run and
   are named in the log. A coin whose accounts could not be read is tried again on the next run,
   three tries in all. A coin still unchecked when it is a day old leaves the queue and is named
   as dropped. A spotted coin whose only red flags can clear with time (holders, the top ten's
   share, the curve, its age) is checked again an hour later, three checks at most, and its newer
   check replaces the older on the floor.
5. The twelve checks, whose thresholds live in one place, `THRESHOLDS` in
   `bots/popcat/checks.mjs`: mint and freeze authority revoked; Token-2022 extensions the
   executor's own audit accepts; the creator holding at most 5% and the ten largest holders (the
   bonding curve and program-held pools excluded) at most 30%, across at least 25 holders; at most 2 other wallets buying
   in the creation slot (a same-slot transaction it could not read counts as one); the creator
   with at most 10 earlier pump.fun launches (when pump.fun does not say, the check reads "not
   available" and is no red flag); at least one social link in its metadata; between 15 minutes
   and 24 hours old; at least 10% of the curve sold; not a copy of an established cat coin; not
   CashCat's. Each check that fails is a red flag, and the site names it in plain words that quote
   these same numbers (a test pins them together).
6. Live only: writes every coin it checked to `callouts.json` with every check and what it found,
   one entry per coin, newest first, the newest 200 kept (`MAX_CALLOUTS` in
   `site/assets/callouts.js`; `capCallouts` in `bots/lib/data.mjs` keeps a callout from the last
   six hours, which the next pick may still choose, ahead of older spotted coins), and the pick
   with them (the newest 28, a week of windows). At the rate seen on 2026-09-25, 200 entries hold
   about three hours of cat coins; older ones stay in the runs' logs, not on the floor.

A callout is a list of checks, never advice, and a red flag is what a check read on chain at that
moment, never an accusation. The site shows the coin's name and ticker as text, the checks, and
links to pump.fun and Solscan; it never shows the coin's picture or follows or prints its links.
On the floor a coin with red flags is "spotted", never "called out"; only a coin with none is a
callout, and only callouts and the pick go in the floor's feed (the spotted coins stay at
Popcat's desk). Popcat holds no key: it cannot buy anything, and it cannot post anything on
pump.fun.

### Popcat's pick, and posting it on pump.fun by hand

pump.fun runs **Callouts** with **Callout Rewards**: a user posts a callout on a token in the
pump.fun app, their followers see it, and when users trade because of it, pump.fun pays the
caller in USDC daily, pro rata, from a pot pump.fun funds. As read in September 2026 in pump.fun's
[Callout Reward terms](https://pump.fun/docs/callout-reward-terms), pump.fun's and its
co-founder's posts on X, and the news: one callout per account every six hours; a ranking that
now favours quality over quantity; **no API for posting a callout**; and terms that **forbid using
"bots, scripts, or other automation to create Callouts"**, multiple or bot accounts, self-dealing,
wash trading, front-running, and fraudulent or misleading callouts, and that **require disclosing
any compensation received or expected and any material position in the asset**. Read the terms
yourself before you post: they change, and this README is not legal advice.

So Popcat never posts a callout. It picks, and the owner decides:

- **When.** The windows start at 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC (`PICK_WINDOW_HOURS` in
  `site/assets/callouts.js`). The first run at or after a window's start (normally the :07 run)
  tries once for that window and records that it tried (`pickWindow` in Popcat's memory). If no
  coin qualifies, that window has no pick; a clean coin found later waits for the next window.
- **Which.** Only a callout (no check found a red flag), checked in the six hours before the run
  (`PICK_LOOKBACK_HOURS`), never picked before, and never CashCat's. Of those, the first by
  `PICK_RANKING` in `bots/popcat/pick.mjs`, each measure higher first: the **distinct holders**
  besides the bonding curve, then the **successful transactions on its bonding curve** that
  Popcat counted (every buy and sell touches the curve; it counts up to 5,000), then **how much
  of its bonding curve had sold**. A tie on all three goes to the mint address that sorts first,
  so the same data always gives the same pick. All three are counts from the chain at the coin's
  check; none is a price, and none says the coin will do well.
- **What it carries.** Its window, when it was chosen, when its checks ran, those three counts
  and the top ten's share, and a **draft** of at most 200 characters (`DRAFT_MAX`) built from the
  checks only: the name and ticker, that twelve on-chain checks found no red flag and when, as
  many of its holders, top-ten share, revoked authorities and curve progress as fit, and the
  disclosure *No position held; may earn callout rewards. Not financial advice.* The site's
  validator refuses a draft over 200 characters, one without the disclosure, and one with a call
  to trade, a price or a promise ("buy", "sell", "moon", "gem", "pump", "profit", "safe", "price",
  "market cap", "100x"…). A coin whose own name or ticker carries such a word is never picked.
- **Where it shows.** As **Popcat's pick** at the top of Popcat's desk and of the floor's feed,
  with its window, and in the **summary of the run** that made it (Actions → Popcat → the run),
  where the draft sits in a box of its own. On the site the draft is text: select it and copy it
  yourself; the page never touches the clipboard.

**Posting it is the owner's act, and the owner's responsibility:**

1. Post it only **by hand**, in the pump.fun app, from **your own single account**. No script,
   bot, scheduler or second account, ever.
2. At most **one callout every six hours**; pump.fun enforces that too.
3. Be **eligible** under the terms: 18 or over, and not a UK or otherwise restricted person.
4. **Hold none of the coin**, before or after, and never trade it; keep the draft's disclosure,
   and disclose anything else the terms ask.
5. Read the coin's checks at its desk before you post: they were true when they ran, not
   necessarily now. Skip a pick you would not stand behind; a pick is a suggestion, never an
   obligation.

The disclosure the site shows with every pick, and the house rules carry: *The agency may post Popcat's pick as a callout on pump.fun, which pays callers from trading their callouts bring. The agency never holds, buys or sells a coin it calls out, and never calls out a coin CashCat launched. Not financial advice.*

### Where the data lives, and how it reaches the site

The bots never commit to `main`. Each run checks out the `floor-data` branch (created on the
first live run that writes something; a dry run commits nothing), writes its file there
(`launches.json`; `callouts.json`, every coin Popcat checked and its picks, and Popcat's memory,
`popcat-state.json`: its queue, where its last listing reached, and the last window it tried) and pushes; two
bots pushing at once rebase and retry, since they write different files. When a file the site
shows changed, the run calls `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, which checks out `main`, lays over
`site/assets/` the entries of `floor-data`'s two files that pass the site's own validators (an
entry that does not, or a coin or a pick of CashCat's, is left out and named in the log, so it
cannot stop a deploy of `main`), runs the site's tests on them (`test-site.mjs`,
`test-bots-data.mjs`), and deploys. A push to `main` deploys through the same overlay, so it
never wipes the floor, and one deploy runs at a time. If `floor-data` cannot be read (the
GitHub API is tried three times) or a file is not JSON of the right shape, the deploy fails
and the live site stays as it was: it is never replaced by an empty floor. The browser checks
every entry again with `site/assets/launches.js` and `site/assets/callouts.js` and draws
everything as text.

### Turning them on

Once this is on `main`, both workflows run on their schedule (Popcat every fifteen minutes, at
:07, :22, :37 and :52; CashCat at 02:23, 10:23 and 18:23 UTC) and can be started by hand under **Actions**. Without the
switches below they are dry runs: read their logs to see what they would do and, for CashCat,
which guards are still red. GitHub Pages must deploy from **GitHub Actions** (Settings →
Pages → Source), as it already does for this site.

**Popcat** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Name | Kind | What |
|---|---|---|
| `POPCAT_LIVE` | variable | `1` to publish every coin it checks, and its picks. Anything else: dry run (its summary still shows the pick it would make). |
| `SOLANA_RPC_URL` | secret | Recommended: your own RPC URL. The public endpoint rate-limits and refuses some reads. |
| `CASHCAT_WALLET_ADDRESS` | variable | CashCat's public address, so its coins are never listed or picked, even before its first launch is on file. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | secret | Optional: a model confirms each coin is a cat and fit to print. |
| `POPCAT_MODEL` | variable | Optional: a model id your key lists (else the first one listed). |

**CashCat** — every row but the optional ones is required for a live launch; a missing one is
named in the run's log and nothing is sent. CashCat's job runs in a GitHub environment named
`cashcat`: create it (Settings → Environments → New environment, `cashcat`), set its
deployment branches to `main` only, and put `CASHCAT_WALLET_SECRET` and `PINATA_JWT` in it as
environment secrets rather than repository secrets (the variables, `CASHCAT_WALLET_ADDRESS`
above all, stay repository variables: Popcat reads that one to leave CashCat's coins alone).
Repository secrets can be read by a workflow run on any branch of this repository or a pull
request from one; environment secrets limited to `main` cannot. (A required reviewer on that
environment would make every run wait for a click.)

| Name | Kind | What |
|---|---|---|
| `CASHCAT_WALLET_SECRET` | secret (in the `cashcat` environment) | The secret key of a **new wallet made only for CashCat**, never the owner's main wallet: base58, or the 64-number array of a `solana-keygen` file. Make it outside this repository, paste it here, and delete the file. |
| `CASHCAT_WALLET_ADDRESS` | variable | That wallet's public address. A live run refuses if it does not match the secret. |
| `SOLANA_RPC_URL` | secret | Your own RPC URL (the public endpoint is used only for dry-run reads and simulations). |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | secret | The model invents and reviews every coin; a live launch needs both. |
| `PINATA_JWT` | secret (in the `cashcat` environment) | A Pinata API JWT: the logo and metadata are pinned on IPFS. |
| `CASHCAT_LIVE` | variable | `1` to launch for real. |
| `CASHCAT_MAX_LAUNCHES_PER_DAY` | variable | Optional, 1 to 6; default 2. |
| `CASHCAT_MIN_BALANCE_SOL` | variable | Optional, at least 0.02; default 0.05. It never launches below this plus the launch's budget. |
| `CASHCAT_DEV_BUY_SOL` | variable | Optional, 0 to 0.05; default 0. pump.fun only, shown with the launch. |
| `CASHCAT_VENUES` | variable | Optional; default `pumpfun,stonkfun`. `pumpfun-xstock` (a pump.fun coin quoted in a tokenised stock) is also built and simulated, but off by default (below). |
| `CASHCAT_STONKFUN_QUOTE`, `CASHCAT_PUMP_XSTOCK_QUOTE` | variable | Optional; default `SPYx`: the stock a coin is paired with. |
| `CASHCAT_PRIORITY_MICROLAMPORTS` | variable | Optional, at most 200,000; default 10,000. |
| `CASHCAT_COLLECT_FEES_MIN_SOL` | variable | Optional; default 0.01: claim pump.fun creator fees once the vault holds this. |
| `CASHCAT_MODEL` | variable | Optional: a model id your key lists. |

Then fund CashCat's wallet. A launch cost 0.0055 SOL (pump.fun), 0.0071 SOL (pump.fun paired
with SPYx) and 0.0087 SOL (StonkFun) in rent and fees when simulated on mainnet on 2026-09-24,
and CashCat keeps its minimum (0.05 SOL by default) plus one launch's budget (0.015 SOL)
untouched, so 0.2 SOL covers sixteen (all StonkFun) to twenty-five (all pump.fun) launches,
about twenty with the two venues taking turns.

To run either bot on your own machine (dry unless you export the switches yourself):

```bash
npm ci && npm ci --prefix bots          # the logo renderer is CashCat's own dependency
node bots/cashcat/run.mjs --logo-out /tmp/cashcat-logo.png
node bots/popcat/run.mjs
```

### What it costs, what can go wrong, and the odds

- **Money.** Each CashCat launch spends its rent and fees (above) from its own wallet, plus
  its dev buy if you set one. Pinata stores two files per launch: the logo (a PNG of about
  400 KB) and a small JSON document. The model is billed
  to your key: CashCat makes at most four short calls a run (three runs a day); Popcat, with
  a key, one short call per new cat coin, at most 30 a run (96 runs a day; 48 new cat coins
  were listed in the 46 minutes of the dry run of 2026-09-25). What that costs depends on the model,
  so set `CASHCAT_MODEL` and `POPCAT_MODEL` to a small one your key lists. On a public
  repository GitHub's standard runners are free; on a private one the runs use the plan's
  minutes, and Popcat uses many: its dry run of 2026-09-25 took about five minutes for 30 checks
  on the public endpoints, and it runs 96 times a day. A dry run keeps no memory, so every dry
  run on Actions reads the whole listing and checks up to 30 coins again.
- **The odds.** Most pump.fun coins never finish their bonding curve, and a CashCat coin has
  nothing behind it but its line on the floor. Expect most launches to cost their fee and earn
  nothing. The only income is pump.fun's creator fee on trades of CashCat's own coins, which it
  claims. StonkFun's platform configs carry a creator fee rate of 0 on chain; whatever
  StonkFun pays creators happens off-chain and was not verified, so CashCat claims nothing
  there. Fees on pump.fun coins quoted in a stock and after a coin graduates are not claimed
  either (below).
- **Reputation and law.** Every coin names the agency. The filters lower the chance of a coin
  that embarrasses it, but a model and a word list can miss things: read the run logs, and
  switch `CASHCAT_LIVE` off if a launch should not have happened (it cannot be undone).
  Launching tokens can carry legal and tax obligations where you live; this README is not
  legal advice.
- **Popcat.** A callout says the checks passed at one moment. A coin that passed can be sold
  off minutes later: the creator can sell, holders can dump, and the same-slot check is a
  heuristic that cannot see wallets funded in advance. A pick is the same callout, chosen by
  counts that say nothing about where a coin goes next. pump.fun's API is undocumented and can
  change or rate-limit without notice; when it does, Popcat lists nothing that run. Its listing
  reaches back only about forty minutes, so runs GitHub delays or skips for longer lose the
  launches in between (the log names the stretch). Posting a pick on pump.fun is the owner's act
  under pump.fun's terms (above), not Popcat's.
- **The key.** CashCat's wallet secret sits in GitHub's secret store and reaches only
  CashCat's step. Kept as a repository secret, anyone who can push a branch to this repository
  (or a token or app that can) can write a workflow that reads it; kept in the `cashcat`
  environment limited to `main`, only a change that lands on `main` can. Either way, the
  packages CashCat's step runs (`@solana/web3.js`, `bs58`, the logo renderer, pinned in the
  lockfiles) see its environment. Keep only what the launches need in that wallet.
- **A launch that is not recorded.** If a run dies after its launch is sent (a timeout, the
  RPC, the push to `floor-data`), the coin is on chain but not on the floor. The next runs see
  it on the wallet and refuse to launch until it is added to `launches.json` on `floor-data`
  by hand, but only for the rest of that day and the next: after that, the coin stays off the
  floor unless someone records it.

### What was verified on mainnet, and what was left out

Everything the bots rely on was read off the chain or a live API on 2026-09-24 and recorded
in `bots/lib/verified.mjs`, with the answers the tests replay under `fixtures/bots/`: pump.fun's
and LaunchLab's IDLs read from their on-chain IDL accounts; eleven real `create_v2`
transactions and six real StonkFun launches whose every account re-derives; StonkFun's platform
configs, its curve rule accounts and its developer API; a real `collect_creator_fee`; and
CashCat's own three launch transactions simulated on mainnet without error (nothing signed or
sent). Both bots then ran dry against mainnet and the live APIs. CashCat read 16 trends and
dropped 2 by its rules, read Jupiter's 3,693 verified tokens, and, with no model key on the
build machine, filled its dry-run-only template coin (White Cat, $WHITECAT), drew its logo,
passed its pre-sign check and simulated the launch with a funded third-party address standing
in as the payer (96,366 compute units, 0.00557 SOL). One Popcat run read 1,093 new and
active coins, kept 29 cat coins, checked them, and found none that passed every check at that
moment; one recorded coin, Asset Cat, passed all twelve when it was captured at 21:35 UTC, and
is the tests' passing fixture. The model calls
of both bots have run only against scripted doubles in the tests. **No coin has been
launched and no callout published.**

On 2026-09-25 pump.fun's newest-coins listing was read again for the new Popcat: it served
offsets 0 to 1,000 and an empty list past that, so it reaches 1,050 coins back and no further; a
`searchTerm` on it was ignored, and `/coins/search` answered 404, so there is no cheaper way to
list only cat coins. The new Popcat then ran dry against mainnet from 02:04 to 02:09 UTC, on
the public RPC with no model key: the listing gave 1,018 coins created from 01:18 to 02:04 UTC
(the recently traded listing answered 429 and was left out, as the log said); 48 were cat coins
new to it, and 4 more cat coins were skipped as not fit to print (2 coins pump.fun marks banned
or NSFW were left out before that); it checked the 30
oldest that were at least 15 minutes old (its budget) and named the 3 left for the next run; the
other 15 were too young and stayed in its queue. None of the 30 passed every check, so it would
have listed all 30 as spotted and made no pick for the 00:00 to 06:00 UTC window. Every one of
them failed the top-10 and holders check (13 had no holder besides the curve) and 28 had sold
less than 10% of their curve; 20 were from creators with more than ten earlier coins, 17 showed
no social link (8 of those because their metadata was not at a plain IPFS link), and 5 had more
than two other wallets buying in their launch slot.

Left out, because it could not be verified: pump.fun "metas" as a trend source (the endpoint
answered 404); pump.fun's own upload endpoint (retired, so metadata goes to Pinata; the upload
itself was checked only as far as its 401 without a key, and a live launch reads every pinned
file back before it builds); claiming creator fees on pump.fun coins quoted in a stock
(`collect_creator_fee_v2`) and after graduation (PumpSwap), which is why `pumpfun-xstock` is off
by default; any StonkFun creator-fee claim (none exists on chain); and `getTokenLargestAccounts`,
which public endpoints refuse (Popcat reads holders with `getProgramAccounts` instead).

## The Cat Intelligence Agency extension — five cats, one download

*One extension, in your own browser, against your own wallet. Nothing here is advice.*

The download is one Chrome extension, **Cat Intelligence Agency**, with the agency's five
software cats inside. The popup has a tab for each, with its pixel sprite:

| Tab | What it does | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **CoinMarketCat** | Agentic trading for Solana in plain English: a strategy you write, a model through your own Anthropic key, limits the model cannot change ([below](#coinmarketcat--the-agentic-trading-cat)). Paper by default | Your Anthropic key; live, the autopilot wallet and an RPC |
| **Snipurr** | The pump.fun sniper lane ([below](#snipurr--the-sniper-lane)). Off, then Observe, before any money moves | An RPC; Phantom or the autopilot wallet |
| **Popcat** | New cat coins on pump.fun, each with Popcat's twelve on-chain checks, as text. It trades nothing | An RPC |
| **CashCat** | Launch a cat coin of your own on pump.fun, from the autopilot wallet, after the agency's content rules and pre-sign checks. Auto mode is off until you arm it | The autopilot wallet, an RPC, your Pinata key; your Anthropic key to draft from a trend |
| **Crying Cat** | A rug check for any mint you paste | An RPC |

The three new cats reuse the agency's bots' own code rather than copies of it: Popcat's checks
(`bots/popcat/checks.mjs`), the cat-word detector and the content rules (`bots/lib/`), CashCat's
trend reader, drafting, ticker check, logo layout, pump.fun builder and pre-sign check
(`bots/cashcat/`, `bots/lib/txcheck.mjs`), and the site's own validator for what may be shown
(`site/assets/callouts.js`). The pieces that were Node-only were split so both run them as they
are: the long given-name list is a module (`bots/lib/given-names.mjs`), and the logo's layout and
drawing (`bots/cashcat/logo-layout.mjs`) are apart from the bot's Node renderer.

**The public mainnet RPC does not work from the extension.** Asked from this extension in
Chromium on 2026-09-25, `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` answered 403 "Access forbidden"
(it refuses requests that carry a browser extension's origin), while pump.fun's API, the IPFS
gateways, Jupiter, Google Trends and CoinGecko answered. So Popcat, Crying Cat and CashCat need
your own RPC, set in Options, like the lanes do; with none set, Popcat and Crying Cat try the
public endpoint and say, on its 403, to set one.

### Popcat in the extension — the cat-coin scanner

The same scan the agency's Popcat runs, for one person. While the popup shows the Popcat tab (it
asks every half minute), and on the extension's half-minute alarm only if you switch background
scanning on (off by default), the service worker reads pump.fun's newest coins, keeps the cat ones
(`detectCat`; a name or ticker the content rules would not print, or the floor's validator would
refuse — HTML, a link scheme, a hidden character — is never shown, not even as waiting), waits
until each is 15 minutes old, and runs Popcat's twelve checks on it against your RPC. Each coin is
listed with its verdict, **NO RED FLAGS FOUND** or **RED FLAGS (n)**, every check with what it
read, and its red flags in the floor's plain words.

- **Text only.** A coin's name and ticker are drawn as text, never HTML; no coin's picture is
  shown; the only links are its pump.fun page and Solscan, built from an address the validator
  accepted, and checked again in the popup before they are drawn. A link the coin supplied (its
  website, its socials, its metadata) is never shown or followed.
- **The pace.** One scan step at a time, not two within twenty seconds, at most two coins checked
  a step (about a dozen RPC reads and two pump.fun reads each, paced per host by the bots' http
  client, which rests a host that answers 429 or 5xx). A failed step rests the scanner from a
  minute, doubling to fifteen; a coin whose accounts do not read is tried three times and dropped.
- **Never your own coins.** Popcat never calls out a coin you launched with CashCat: a coin in
  your CashCat journal, or whose creator is your autopilot wallet — as pump.fun lists it or as its
  bonding curve records it on chain — is never listed.
- **No trading.** The tab's code names no signer and no wallet key. A callout is a list of checks
  at one moment, never advice.

### Crying Cat in the extension — a rug check for any mint

Paste a mint address, or a pump.fun coin link of exactly the form
`https://pump.fun/coin/<address>`; anything else is refused before anything is read, and what you
pasted is never fetched. Crying Cat reads the chain and reports, with plain-language notes: the
mint and freeze authority; the Token-2022 extensions against the audit the trading lanes run; the
holders, with the bonding curve and every program-held account (pools, vaults) left out, against
Popcat's thresholds (the ten largest over 30%, or fewer than 25 holders); the creator's share when
the coin's pump.fun curve names its creator; whether the coin has graduated or how much of its
curve has sold; and whether it copies an established cat coin, when the mint carries its name. A
token too big to list (the RPC refuses, or the answer passes the size cap) is read from its 20
largest accounts, and the count says it was not counted. A wallet, a token account or an empty
address is said to be one. The name and ticker the mint carries on chain are drawn as text, with
any direction override or invisible character dropped. One check runs at a time, at most one
every three seconds. A red flag is what the chain said at that moment, never an accusation.
**Grumpy Cat** (fake hype) is not in the extension: telling real hype from fake needs social data
it does not have.

### CashCat in the extension — launch a cat coin of your own

**Drafting.** Type a coin — its name, ticker, one line and the topic it riffs on, and the kitten
and background of its logo — or ask CashCat to draft one from a trend: it reads Google Trends' US
feed and CoinGecko's trending categories (each topic through `checkTrend` first) and asks the
model, through your Anthropic key and the model picked at run time from `GET /v1/models`, to
propose a coin, then asks it again as a separate reviewer. Every draft, either way, passes the
bots' rules before it can be launched: `checkTrend` on its topic (with the long given-name list),
`checkProposal` on its words, Jupiter's verified tickers and the established cat coins, the site's
record validator, and the model's review whenever a key is saved. Each refusal is named.

**The logo** is drawn in the service worker on an OffscreenCanvas from the bot's own files, copied
into the build byte for byte: one of the eight kitten bases (1024 × 1024) with the ticker on its
sign in Press Start 2P (SIL Open Font License, bundled unmodified with its licence). Each sign is
measured from the pixels with the bot's own `measureSign` and must equal the bot's recorded
rectangle; the test draws the same logo with the bot's renderer and compares the pixels.

**The metadata** is pinned on IPFS through **your own Pinata account**: the logo and a JSON
document in pump.fun's shape, read back from Pinata's public gateway before its URI is used. The
description ends **"Not financial advice. Not affiliated with [the topic]."** It does not claim to
be from the Cat Intelligence Agency and carries no agency website: your coin is yours. A "Made with
CashCat." line is added only if you tick it in Options (off by default). The Pinata JWT is kept like
the Anthropic key: in `chrome.storage.local`, read by the service worker alone, sent only to
Pinata's upload API in one header, never shown again (`test-cats-no-leak.mjs`).

**The transaction** is pump.fun's `create_v2`, SOL-quoted, built by the bot's verified builder
(`bots/cashcat/pumpfun.mjs`) as a v0 transaction with no lookup table. Before any signature it
passes the bot's pre-sign check on the compiled message (exactly the autopilot wallet and the new
mint as signers, at most two compute-budget instructions, one `create_v2` whose sixteen accounts
and decoded arguments are the planned ones) and a simulation on your RPC that must succeed, log
`CreateV2` and cost the wallet at most the bot's launch budget, 0.015 SOL. It is built and
simulated once with a placeholder URI before anything is pinned, and again with the real one.
"Check the launch" does all of that and shows the simulated cost without pinning, signing or
sending; launching needs the ticker typed to confirm. StonkFun launches, and pump.fun coins quoted
in a stock, stay the agency's CashCat's for now.

**Who signs: the autopilot wallet only.** A create needs two signatures: the payer's and the new
mint's. The mint's keypair is made in `src/lib/session-wallet.mjs` (the one file that may hold a
key), used once to add its signature, and dropped — memory only, never storage; then the engine's
`signSendConfirm`, bound to the autopilot wallet, signs, checks the message is the one that was
checked, sends and confirms. **Phantom is not offered for CashCat**: whether Phantom keeps another
signer's signature on a v0 transaction it is asked to sign (rather than dropping it or changing the
message, which some wallets do to add their own instructions) could not be verified here, so the
autopilot wallet is the only signer.

**The dev buy** is 0 by default, at most 0.05 SOL, manual launches only, and shown: a separate
transaction after the launch lands, built by the bot's builder and held to its dev-buy check.

**Auto mode** (off by default) drafts from a trend, has the model review the draft, and launches
it from the autopilot wallet on a schedule (every 2 to 24 hours) while Chrome is open. You arm it
by typing the sentence it prints, which names the autopilot wallet and every cap; changing a cap or
the wallet disarms it. Its hard caps: **at most 2 launches a UTC day** (every launch from the
extension counts, manual or automatic), never below your minimum balance (0.05 SOL by default,
at least 0.02) plus one launch's budget, **no dev buy**, and nothing after a launch: **it never
buys or sells the coins it launched**, from any wallet, and uses no other wallet. The first run is
ten minutes after arming; each run schedules the next before it starts, so a refusal never
retries every half minute.

**The journal** keeps every launch — its mint, its signature, its topic or trend, what it cost —
and every refusal. A launch is written as "sending" before it is signed; a launch whose outcome
could not be read blocks the next until you check it on Solscan and mark it, and disarms auto mode.
The journal keeps its newest 200 entries, and never trims away a launch that still blocks the next
one or counts against the day's cap. A disarm, or a cap changed in Options, always wins over a
run on the alarm: the settings are changed under one lock, and a run checks it is still armed
before it pins and again before anything is signed.

### Permissions and hosts, for the Chrome Web Store

The permissions are `storage`, `alarms` and `notifications`, and nothing else
(`test-hawk-manifest.mjs`). The three new cats added none. The content script runs on the agency's
console page only. The host permissions, and why each is needed:

| Host permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `https://*/*` | The Solana RPC is whatever https URL the user pastes in Options (Helius, Triton, QuickNode or their own node), so no fixed host list can name it; every other request goes to one of the fixed hosts listed with its reason (the agent's model, prices and swaps; Popcat's pump.fun listing and IPFS metadata; CashCat's trends, verified-token list and Pinata uploads). A fetch permission only: the extension injects nothing into any page but the agency's console page. |
| `wss://*/*` | Snipurr's live feed is one logsSubscribe websocket to the same user-chosen RPC (its wss URL, or the one derived from the https URL). |

Every fixed host the extension calls, which cat calls it, and why:

| Host | Called by | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `api.anthropic.com` | CoinMarketCat, CashCat | the model, with the user's own API key (list the models; the agent's decisions; CashCat's drafts and reviews) |
| `api.dexscreener.com` | CoinMarketCat, Snipurr | prices for the agent's tokens; new pools paired with a stock (off by default) |
| `api.geckoterminal.com` | CoinMarketCat, Snipurr | 15-minute candles for the agent; new pools (off by default) |
| `api.jup.ag` | CoinMarketCat, Snipurr | quotes, swaps and fallback prices, keyless |
| `datapi.jup.ag` | Snipurr | Jupiter's newest launchpad pools, only if the user chooses that feed |
| `frontend-api-v3.pump.fun` | Popcat | pump.fun's newest coins and a creator's launch count |
| `pump.mypinata.cloud` | Popcat | a coin's metadata by its IPFS CID, to see whether it names a social link (none is shown or followed) |
| `gateway.pinata.cloud` | Popcat, CashCat | the same metadata by CID; CashCat reads back what it pinned |
| `uploads.pinata.cloud` | CashCat | pins the logo and metadata of the user's coin, with the user's own Pinata JWT |
| `trends.google.com` | CashCat | Google Trends' US trending-searches feed, for drafting from a trend |
| `api.coingecko.com` | CashCat | CoinGecko's trending categories, for drafting from a trend |
| `lite-api.jup.ag` | CashCat, CoinMarketCat | Jupiter's token list: no CashCat draft may take a verified token's ticker or name, and a custom CoinMarketCat mint must be a cat coin by its name there |
| `api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` | Popcat, Crying Cat | tried for reads only when no RPC is set; it answers 403 to the extension, and both then ask for an RPC |
| a new coin's metadata host (usually an IPFS gateway) | Snipurr | its socials check (on by default): one read of the document its creator named, with a deadline and a size cap; its links are never followed |

### Privacy: what stays in your browser, and what is sent where

There is no Cat Intelligence Agency server: nothing the extension does is sent to the agency.

**Stored in this browser** (`chrome.storage.local`, readable by the extension alone): your
settings for each lane and cat; the agent's strategy, positions and journal; Snipurr's book and
shadow book; the autopilot wallet's key, encrypted under your passphrase; your Anthropic API key;
your Pinata JWT; Popcat's scan (the coins it checked, the queue); CashCat's settings, current draft
and journal. **In memory only** (`chrome.storage.session`): the autopilot wallet's unlocked key,
while it is unlocked. The new mint's key of a CashCat launch is never stored at all.

**Sent, and where:**

- **Anthropic** (`api.anthropic.com`), with your key: the agent's context (the strategy, the
  prices and indicators, the vault, the positions, the limits, recent decisions); CashCat's trends
  and drafts for a proposal or a review; the model list.
- **Pinata** (`uploads.pinata.cloud`, with your JWT; `gateway.pinata.cloud` without it): your
  coin's logo and metadata document, and the read-back. Popcat reads other coins' metadata by CID
  through `gateway.pinata.cloud` and `pump.mypinata.cloud`, with nothing of yours.
- **Your RPC**: every chain read, simulation and transaction the lanes and cats make, with your
  wallets' public addresses, the mints you check or trade, and the signed transactions you send.
- **pump.fun** (`frontend-api-v3.pump.fun`): Popcat's requests for the newest coins and a
  creator's launch count. Nothing of yours.
- **Jupiter** (`api.jup.ag`, `lite-api.jup.ag`, `datapi.jup.ag` if chosen): quotes and swaps with
  your wallet's public key; the verified-token list for CashCat.
- **DexScreener** and **GeckoTerminal**: the tokens the agent prices, and (if you turn it on) new
  pools paired with a stock. Nothing of yours but which tokens you watch.
- **Google Trends** and **CoinGecko**: CashCat's trend feeds, only when you draft from a trend or
  auto mode runs. Nothing of yours.
- **The console page** (`catintelligenceagency.com/console/`, in a tab you open): the lanes'
  status for the page to draw, and the transactions Phantom is asked to sign. Never a key.

## CoinMarketCat — the agentic trading cat

*Agentic trading for Solana, in plain English. You write the plan; code keeps the limits.*

CoinMarketCat is the Cat Intelligence Agency extension's trading cat: it trades Solana spot
tokens from a strategy you describe in your own words. You name an agent, write its strategy, choose up to ten tokens
and set hard limits; on the schedule you choose it asks a model — through **your own
Anthropic API key** — what to do, and deterministic code then decides what of that is
allowed. It starts on **paper**. It trades live only from the autopilot wallet you fund and
unlock, and only after you type the sentence that arms it. It is **spot only**, with no
leverage, and it **runs only while Chrome is open** on your computer. Nothing about its
returns has been measured.

Beside it in the extension is **Snipurr**, the sniper cat: the pump.fun launch sniper the
extension started as, unchanged, [documented below](#snipurr--the-sniper-lane).

CoinMarketCat is not affiliated with CoinMarketCap. Its agent follows the shape of the
"agentic trading" idea CoinMarketCap describes publicly — a plain-English strategy, a
universe, risk limits enforced by code, a vault the owner alone controls, a journal of
every decision — on Solana spot instead of leveraged futures, and in your browser instead
of a hosted service. The strategy marketplace and profit share that idea includes are
**not built** (they would need a server this project does not have).

### How the agent works

Every half minute the service worker's alarm runs one tick (`src/lib/agent-runner.mjs`):

1. **Snapshot.** One DexScreener request prices every token in the universe: price, 1 h
   and 24 h change, 24 h volume, liquidity (`src/lib/agent-market.mjs`). A token DexScreener
   does not price is asked of Jupiter's price API. A figure a source did not give is `null`
   and named as missing — never guessed, never carried over.
2. **Protections**, before anything else and whether or not the model is reachable: the
   stop loss, the take profit and the daily drawdown breaker (`src/lib/agent-risk.mjs`).
3. **The model**, only while running and only when its schedule (15, 30 or 60 minutes)
   comes round. It is shown the owner's strategy (in the system prompt, after the rules),
   the snapshot plus RSI(14), EMA(20), EMA(50) and 1 h / 4 h / 24 h returns computed here
   from GeckoTerminal's 15-minute candles, the vault, the positions, the P&L, the limits
   (read-only) and its last five decisions. It must answer through one tool,
   `submit_decisions`: a rationale and a list of `buy` (in dollars), `sell` (a fraction of
   the position) or `hold`, each with a confidence and a reason (`src/lib/agent-brain.mjs`).
4. **The limits** turn the proposal into clamped orders and named refusals.
5. **Execute**, sells first. Paper fills at Jupiter's quote; live runs Jupiter's
   transaction through the check before signing and has the autopilot wallet sign it.
6. **Journal**: every decision with its rationale and what became of each action, every
   refusal with its clause, every fill (with its signature when live), the breaker, the
   controls, and the tokens each model call used. It keeps the last 300 entries, in
   `chrome.storage.local`, and the popup shows them.

A model failure — the network, a timeout, a 401/429/5xx, a refusal, an answer with no
tool call, or a tool input that is not exactly the decision format (a field it does not
have, such as a limit, refuses the whole decision) — means **no new entries that tick**,
journaled by its clause. The protections run regardless.

### The limits

The model cannot change any of these: they are read from the spec the owner saved, which
nothing the model returns can write. Every clause is walked in `test-agent-risk.mjs`.

| Limit | Default | Fence | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| Most in one token | $25 | $10 and up | a buy is clamped to what is left under it (`position_cap`) |
| Most of the vault in tokens | 60% | 1–100% | pending buys count too (`exposure_cap`) |
| Stop loss | 8% under entry | 0.5–50% | the whole position is sold, every half minute (`stop_loss`) |
| Take profit | 15% over entry | 0.5–1000% | the whole position is sold, every half minute (`take_profit`) |
| Daily drawdown | 5% | 0.5–50% | measured from the vault's value at the start of the UTC day, which a deposit or a withdrawal moves with it (a flow is not a loss); at the limit the breaker trips until UTC midnight and either stops new buys or sells everything (`drawdown_breaker`, `drawdown_liquidate`) |
| Trades a day | 6 | 1–96 | the model's buys and sells per UTC day; a stop or take never counts and is never refused (`trades_per_day`) |
| Least confidence for a buy | 0.6 | 0–1 | a buy the model rates under it is refused; a sell never is; 0 turns it off (`below_min_confidence`) |
| Slippage | 100 bps | 10–300 bps | written into every Jupiter instruction; a quote or transaction that says otherwise is refused |
| Minimum trade | $10 | fixed | a smaller buy, or a partial sell worth less, is refused (`below_min_trade`); a whole position may always be sold |
| Minimum vault | $50 | fixed | no buys below it (`vault_below_minimum`), and the model is not called when nothing is held |
| Buy price impact | 2% | fixed | a buy whose quote moves the price more — the whole route's impact, through SOL or not — is refused (`impact_over_cap`); a sell never is |

A buy is clamped in order — the per-token cap, the settlement balance, the exposure cap —
and refused, naming the tightest, when what is left is under $10. Only tokens in the
universe may be traded (`not_in_universe`); the settlement token cannot be traded into;
a second action for one token in one tick is refused; no buys while paused (`paused`) or
after the breaker trips. The proceeds of a sell are not spent by a buy in the same tick.

**The universe is cat coins only**, at most ten: the **Solana cat coins** preset — MEW,
POPCAT, KITTY, GRUMPY, KWIF and KHAI — and any other cat coin on Solana added as a custom
mint. The preset is every cat coin Jupiter's token API marks verified that is a classic SPL
Token mint with no mint authority and no freeze authority, read back as a mint account on
mainnet on 2026-09-25; the bytes and each coin's pool liquidity that day are in
`fixtures/agent/cats-verified.json`, and `test-agent-strategy.mjs` re-derives every decimals
and token-program figure from them. Simon's Cat (CAT) was left out: it keeps a mint
authority. A custom mint is read over your RPC when you save it (its decimals and program
come from the chain; a Token-2022 mint with a transfer fee, a live hook or a pause is
refused), and its name and ticker are looked up on Jupiter's token list: one that is not a
cat by the check Popcat uses (`bots/lib/catdetect.mjs`) is refused at `not_a_cat_coin`.
**Most cat coins are thin.** On 2026-09-25 MEW had about $10.6M in its pools and POPCAT
about $5.0M; KITTY about $220k and the other three $22k–$43k, where the 2% buy-impact cap
and a small per-token cap decide what can be bought. **SOL itself is not in this version**:
buying SOL delivers wrapped SOL, and the check before signing is a port that dropped the
executor's wrapped-SOL branches, so the wrapped-SOL mint is refused by name
(`sol_not_in_v1`). It is not a cat coin in any case.

**Most cat coins trade against SOL, not USDC — so a swap may take one hop through SOL.**
Asked for direct routes from USDC on 2026-09-25, Jupiter had one only for POPCAT; MEW,
KITTY, GRUMPY, KWIF and KHAI answered `NO_ROUTES_FOUND` both ways, and from USDT not one
of the six had a direct route, POPCAT included
(`fixtures/agent/jupiter-cat-route-shapes.json`). So the agent, on paper and live alike,
asks Jupiter for a short route — `onlyDirectRoutes=false`,
`restrictIntermediateTokens=true`, `maxAccounts=24` (Jupiter cannot be told which token to
pass through; at 24 all twelve USDC answers, six coins both ways, and all six USDT buys
went through SOL alone, while at 32 two USDC answers took a second token) — and takes it
only if it is direct or passes through **exactly one intermediate, SOL**. A second hop is
refused (`route_too_many_hops`), so is any other intermediate
(`route_intermediate_not_sol`) and a route whose parts go different ways
(`route_split_intermediates`). The SOL in the middle is not a position and never touches
the wallet: Jupiter holds it in its own account for the length of the transaction (see
*Paper and live*). The 2% buy-impact cap is the whole route's: the KITTY buy quote
recorded that morning, 2.50% for $10, is refused.

**The settlement token** is USDC by default, or USDT, counted at face value. Every buy
spends it and every sell returns it, so every trade is a swap between the settlement token
and a cat coin — straight, or through SOL held by Jupiter — the kind the check before
signing handles. USDC, USDT and cbBTC keep a freeze authority held by their issuers.

### Paper and live

- **Paper** (the default) starts a paper vault ($100 unless you change it, at least $50)
  and fills every order at the output Jupiter quotes for it. Nothing is signed; no wallet
  and no RPC are needed, only your API key. A quote is not a fill: a real trade can come in
  lower, down to the slippage cap.
- **Live** trades from the **autopilot wallet** (see [Who signs](#who-signs-phantom-per-trade-or-autopilot)).
  Fund it from Phantom with at least $50 of the settlement token — the popup's *Fund from
  Phantom* now offers USDC and USDT beside SOL — and a little SOL (the checklist asks for
  0.02) for network fees and each token's account rent. Unlock it, set an RPC in Options,
  and type the sentence the agent prints, which names the agent, the autopilot wallet, the
  settlement token, every limit and every token; change any of them and it must be typed
  again. Every live swap is Jupiter's transaction run through the check the xStock venue
  uses: the pair must be the settlement token and a listed token, either way
  (`allowedPairs`, refused at `pair_not_allowed` inside `checkSwapTransaction`); the route
  decoded and bound to the quote, its step count and the last step's token indexes too; the
  lookup tables resolved on your RPC; the wallet's other token accounts untouched; the
  engine's simulation guard on the settlement-token and token deltas; the exact input; both
  accounts safe after the simulation. A swap through SOL is built on **Jupiter's shared
  accounts**: the SOL in the middle sits in a wrapped-SOL account of one of Jupiter's own
  program authorities, and the only accounts of the autopilot wallet the transaction names
  are its settlement-token and cat-coin accounts. Built the other way (Jupiter's plain
  `route_v2`), the hop holds that SOL in the wallet's own wrapped-SOL account and leaves the
  account behind; that is refused (`intermediate_in_wallet`), as is any route that names or
  creates the wallet's wrapped-SOL account, and after the simulation that account must be
  exactly as it was. Every token account a hop writes must hold the settlement token, SOL or
  the cat coin (`route_intermediate_not_sol`). And on every swap, hop or not, the wallet's
  SOL may move by the transaction's own fee and the rent of the accounts it creates and not
  one lamport more; a transfer or sync that turns its SOL into swap input is refused
  (`sol_as_input`) — the autopilot's SOL pays fees, never the trade. Then the engine's
  `signSendConfirm`, bound to the autopilot wallet, signs without a window, sends, confirms,
  and the fill is read back from the chain. A live USDC → POPCAT transaction Jupiter built
  on 2026-09-25 passes that check (`fixtures/agent/jupiter-usdc-popcat-swap.json`), and so
  do USDC → MEW and USDC → KITTY through SOL, both ways (`fixtures/agent/jupiter-usdc-mew-swap.json`,
  `fixtures/agent/jupiter-usdc-kitty-swap.json`); the same MEW buy as Jupiter built it without
  shared accounts is refused.

### Your API key, and what the model costs

There is no CoinMarketCat server, so the agent calls the Anthropic Messages API with **your
own key** (bring your own key). Paste it in **Options → Agent**: it is kept in
`chrome.storage.local`, read by the service worker alone, sent only to
`https://api.anthropic.com` in the `x-api-key` header, never shown again, never logged, and
never given to a content script, a web page or the site. `test-agent-no-leak.mjs` pins that
in the source, in the built bundles and through the running worker.

No model identifier is written anywhere in this repository. The model is chosen at run
time: Options lists the models your key may use (`GET /v1/models`), newest first, and with
none picked the agent uses the first one listed. Every call is billed to your key: one per
tick that the schedule comes round (every 15 minutes is 96 calls a day), plus one to list
the models. The journal and the popup show the tokens each call used. If a model refuses a
forced tool choice, the agent asks once more with the tool choice left to the model, and
remembers that for it.

### What runs where

- **In your browser**: the agent, its limits, its journal, the autopilot wallet, your key.
  It runs while Chrome is open on this computer — close Chrome or let it sleep and nothing
  runs, not the model and not the stop loss. It is not a cloud service and it does not run
  around the clock.
- **Anthropic's API**: the model calls, on your key.
- **Keyless public data**: DexScreener (one request per tick, 300 a minute allowed),
  GeckoTerminal (15-minute candles, only when the model is due, 2.1 s apart, a 429 rests it
  a minute and doubles), Jupiter (quotes, swaps and fallback prices on ONE client shared with
  Snipurr's xStock venue, at the keyless 0.5 requests a second).
- **Your RPC**: live reads, simulations and sends only.
- **Nowhere else.** The site never talks to any of this; the agent's live data stays in the
  extension.

### The controls

In the popup's **Agent** tab: **Start** (on paper, or live with the typed sentence),
**Pause** (the model is not asked; the protections keep running), **Decide now** (ask the
model at the next tick), **Liquidate all** (every position sold back to the settlement token
through the same checks, then paused; what does not sell at once is tried again every tick
until it does, or until you resume), **Withdraw**, and **Stop** (what is still held keeps
its protections). Pause, Stop, Liquidate all and Withdraw stop new buys from the moment you
press them, even from a decision the model is still making. **Withdraw** is yours alone: it
pauses the agent and runs the existing sweep of the autopilot wallet — every token, then the
SOL above the rent floor — to your connected Phantom address, then closes the agent's rows
for what left as withdrawn; while the sweep runs, the agent's ticks stand aside. The model
cannot name it (only `buy`, `sell` and `hold` exist), and the runner has no code path from a
decision to a sweep. While the agent holds live positions the autopilot card's plain *Sweep*
refuses and points to Withdraw.

If Chrome closes or the worker is ended mid-trade, what was booked is already stored: the
book is written after every fill and before each model call. A live buy that was sent and
whose outcome cannot be read — or that was being signed when the worker stopped — **pauses
the agent**: it may have landed as tokens the book does not hold, which no stop loss
watches. The journal and a notification say so; check the wallet before resuming.

### What the agency's real money taught it

HAWK-AI's 64 real round trips and the Claude Co desk's 132 graded calls and 20 live trades,
set beside the published results for LLM trading agents, are in
[docs/coinmarketcat-lessons.md](docs/coinmarketcat-lessons.md). Three things follow from
them: the confidence floor above, since the desk's low-conviction calls were all of its loss;
a **vs buy and hold** line in the popup and in the model's context, since most published
agents did not beat simply holding; and the measured facts, stated in every system prompt.

### What is not measured, and what it is not

- **Unmeasured.** No win rate, no return and no drawdown from a real run, paper or live.
  A model deciding from a snapshot of prices and a few indicators is not evidence of an edge.
- **Not 24/7**: it runs while Chrome is open. **Not leveraged**: spot only.
- **Not free to run**: every model call costs your own API credits, and every live trade a
  network fee in SOL.
- **Not a marketplace**: sharing or selling a strategy, and any profit share, is not built.
- **No live agent trade has been made on mainnet.** The live path is proven against the
  scripted chain in `test-agent-runner.mjs` and against Jupiter's recorded live transactions
  (USDC → POPCAT direct, USDC → MEW and USDC → KITTY through SOL), and nowhere else.

## Snipurr — the sniper lane

*Snipurr, the sniper cat. It hovers ten seconds over every launch and buys only what others followed.*

Snipurr is CoinMarketCat's pump.fun sniper lane — the Claude Company launch sniper's lane
(HAWK-AI's), run in your own browser, and the lane this extension started as. You set the
limits: the take-profit, the SOL per trade, the daily budget it will not exceed, the stop,
and which stock-paired tokens to focus on. You also choose who signs:

- **Phantom, one approval per trade** (the default). The extension holds no key. Every buy
  and every sell is one Phantom window on the console tab.
- **Autopilot.** The extension generates one wallet of its own, keeps its key encrypted
  under your passphrase, and — while you have it unlocked — signs the lane's buys and
  sells without asking. You fund it from Phantom with one approval and sweep it back when
  you are done. This is the one mode in which the extension holds a key; see
  [Who signs](#who-signs-phantom-per-trade-or-autopilot) for exactly what that means. The
  agent's live mode uses the same wallet.

When you install it, a setup page opens and walks you through Snipurr's limits and the
wallet before anything can spend. It sits in the popup's **Snipurr** tab.

It ships in the Cat Intelligence Agency extension, which you load unpacked: the download
(`cat-intelligence-agency-extension.zip`), or a build from this repository. It is not in a store.

### What it does

- **Watches pump.fun's own program logs** and runs every launch through the same entry
  contract WALL-ST-E runs. The contract, the exit determiner, the curve arithmetic, the
  proved `buy_v2`/`sell_v2` encoders and the shadow book are the executor's own modules,
  copied verbatim from a named commit of
  [Claude-Company](https://github.com/gtjvv976mb-netizen/Claude-Company) into
  `vendor/executor/` and hashed in `PROVENANCE.json`. What this bot refuses is decided
  upstream and synced here, never edited here.
- **Hovers, then buys only what others followed.** Every launch that clears opens a
  would-have position. In an armed lane, only once that position is ten seconds old
  **and still marks at or above its own would-have fill** does the lane re-read the
  curve, rebuild and simulate the exact instruction it will sign, and ask Phantom (or, on
  autopilot, have the autopilot wallet sign it).
- **Leaves in full** at the 1.5× take, the stop, the creator's exit, the 90-second stall
  or the three-minute clock — each one more Phantom window, or on autopilot, none.
- **Keeps the executor's shadow book**, exported as the JSONL
  `node vendor/executor/grade-entry-gates.mjs --file <export>` reads, with the scorecard
  for the two entry rulers live in the popup.
- **Puts its own losing record beside the arming switch.** The lane starts **Off**; you choose Observe before you ever choose Execute.
- **Trades on its own, if you choose autopilot** — from a wallet you funded, inside the
  same caps, with the balance as one more cap the chain enforces.
- **Can pay in a tokenised stock, if you list one.** pump.fun "Custom Pairs" let a launch be
  priced in a token instead of SOL; the ones this lane is built and tested for are xStocks
  (GLDx, TSLAx, SPYx), paid from the stock already in your wallet. With nothing listed — the
  default — every such launch is refused, as before. See [Launches quoted in a stock](#launches-quoted-in-a-stock-pumpfun-custom-pairs).
- **Can watch new pools paired with a stock anywhere on Solana, if you turn it on.** A second
  venue, **off by default**, polls public new-pool feeds for pools on any exchange that pair
  a token with an xStock you watch, and trades them through Jupiter, paid in that stock,
  inside that stock's limits. It follows the lane: Observe only watches. See
  [New pools paired with a stock, through Jupiter](#new-pools-paired-with-a-stock-through-jupiter-off-by-default).

### What HAWK-AI's trades taught it

The executor's live record, read back off mainnet in full on 2026-09-17 (the tables are
in Claude-Company's `executor/README.md`):

| | |
|---|---|
| first 58 round trips | **10 up, 48 down, −1.58 SOL**; average winner +75%, average loser −22% |
| six more, under the socials filter and the stall exit | 1 up, 5 down, −0.07 SOL |
| positions that ran to the old ten-minute clock | **18, none won** |
| where the net loss sat | every SOL of it in tickets of 0.35 SOL and up |
| entries under 3 seconds late | 9, **0 won**, mean −18.5% |
| entries 10 seconds and later | 10, 40% won, mean +34% |
| coins that reached 1.5× after the fill | 28 of 64; the bot took it on 5 |
| any signal at entry that ordered the outcome | none (every Spearman ρ under 0.13) |
| the best modelled exit ladder over the 64 | still −0.12 SOL |

The wait, the follow-through rule and the 1.5× take follow from that record. **None of it
is evidence of an edge.** The record loses, every modelled variant of it loses, and
nothing measured at entry orders the outcome. What the record supports is a rule that
keeps this lane out of the one bucket that never won, and a book that will say — over
thousands of unselected rows — whether anything separates a good launch from a bad one.

Wiring this lane also found a bug in the executor: an unset `SNIPE_STALL_MS` read as
`0`, which is *off*, so the 90-second stall exit was never running by default. The fix
and its regression (`vendor/executor/test-snipe-stall-default.mjs`) are in the vendored
commit.

### Launches quoted in a stock (pump.fun Custom Pairs)

In **Options → Stock quotes** you may list up to eight stock mints, each with its own
numbers **in that stock's units**: a ticket per launch, a canary (the first buy), and a
rolling 24-hour cap. The shortcuts for GLDx, TSLAx and SPYx carry the addresses and symbols
read from each mint account on mainnet (the vendored fixture
`vendor/executor/fixtures/pumpfun-xstock-quote.json`). What the lane then does:

- **It reads the stock's mint on the same call as the curve.** A listed stock's mint account
  rides on the one `getMultipleAccounts` every launch already costs, and the executor's
  `describeMint` reads its token program, decimals and pause switch. It is *described*,
  never *audited*: the base-mint kill set (`auditMintAccount`) rightly refuses every xStock,
  because each carries a permanent delegate, a live freeze authority and a pause switch
  held by its issuer. The executor's entry contract gets those facts as `quote` and judges
  the ticket, the minimum and the day cap in the stock's raw units.
- **It refuses** a stock that is not listed, a listed symbol that is not the mint's own, a
  paused stock (at first notice, at the moment of asking, and it will not ask Phantom to
  sell while one is paused), a stock whose transfer hook points at a live program, a wallet
  holding less of the stock than the buy's ceiling, and a buy whose SOL fee and rent would
  break the SOL day cap. Each refusal says which.
- **It pays through the right accounts.** The quote's token program is the stock mint's
  owner (Token-2022 for an xStock), never assumed; the wallet's stock account is its
  179-byte Token-2022 associated account, created idempotently before the buy and the sell.
  The simulation must show the stock account paying at most the ceiling and SOL moving by
  the fee and rent caps only; the fill is read from the transaction's token balances in the
  stock's decimals, and a lamport that is not fee or rent is a refusal, not a fee.
- **It books in the stock.** A stock position's size, P&L and day ledger are in the stock;
  its network fee and rent are SOL, reported beside it and charged to the SOL day. The two
  are never added together: there is no SOL price for an xStock in this lane. The shadow
  book grades stock-quoted launches on their own card per stock, never pooled with SOL.
- **The first live buy in each stock is a canary.** No buy on a stock-quoted pump.fun curve
  had been observed on chain when this was built — only one sell — so the buy's account
  order rests on the venue's IDL and the SOL buys it was proven against. The first live buy
  in each listed stock is sized at its canary (`minPerTrade`); the full ticket is used only
  after one buy in that stock has landed and its fill was read back off the chain. A buy
  that lands but cannot be read back or booked **blocks** that stock, says so in the log,
  the notification and the popup, and stays blocked until you check the signature, sell
  by hand, and press *clear the block*. The popup shows each stock's state (canary, proven,
  blocked), and the arm sentence names each stock's canary and mint.

**What is not measured.** HAWK-AI's record is SOL-quoted launches only. Nothing is known
about stock-quoted launches: not a win rate, not whether they follow through, not the fee
on a buy (one sell was read: 125 bps of the quote), not the compute a two-account-create
buy uses. A stock-quoted row's round-trip friction cannot include its SOL fees, so the stop
you choose is its only stop, and the lane will not arm with a stock listed until you have
chosen one. SPYx carries a display multiplier: Phantom shows it scaled, this lane shows the
raw count over 10^8. A coin that graduates to a pool must be sold by hand, as with SOL.

### New pools paired with a stock, through Jupiter (off by default)

The pump.fun lane hears launches from the pump.fun program's own logs. Tokens are also
launched straight into pools on Raydium, Meteora, Orca and launchpads, paired with an xStock
instead of SOL, and there is no single program to listen to for those. This venue reads what
public indexers publish about new pools and trades the ones that pass its gates through
Jupiter. Turn it on in the popup's **Venues** card (or Options). With the lane on **Observe**
it only watches; it buys only when the lane is armed, and the arm sentence names it.

**Where it looks** (Options → *Feeds*; each was read live on 2026-09-24 and its captured
answer is in `fixtures/xstock-pools/`):

| feed | what it is | what to know |
|---|---|---|
| GeckoTerminal `new_pools` | the 20 newest Solana pools of any pair | cached 30–60 s; the free tier answered 429 to the first request of the session |
| DexScreener `token-pairs` | up to 30 pools of one stock, either side | ordered by liquidity, so a pool with none yet can be missed; 300 requests a minute |
| Jupiter `gems` (opt-in) | the 30 newest launchpad pools, with their quote mint | **undocumented**; it may change or stop without notice |

It watches the stocks you listed in Options → Stock quotes. With none listed it watches a
built-in list of fifteen xStocks (addresses from the official product page, read
2026-09-24) and can only observe them: a stock with no ticket is refused at
`stock_not_listed`. Every pool found is recorded in the popup with the feed that found it,
how old it was when first seen, and what became of it. A feed that answers 429 or fails rests
a minute (a `retry-after: 0` is not trusted), and longer each time it keeps failing.

**What it pays with.** The pool's own stock, from the stock already in your wallet, at that
stock's listed ticket, canary and 24-hour cap — the same numbers and the same day ledger the
pump.fun stock lane uses. Jupiter is asked for **direct routes only**, so the swap goes from
the stock to the token on a pool that pairs them, and nothing else touches the wallet (the
one hop through SOL CoinMarketCat's agent may take is never asked for here). The
network fee and the token account's rent are SOL, charged to the SOL day; on autopilot the
wallet's SOL balance must cover them.

**What it refuses, and in what order** (the first gate that fails names the refusal):

- *in-process:* the lane or venue off, no RPC, HARD STOP, paused entries; `no_new_token` (the
  other side is SOL, USDC, USDT or another stock: a market in the stock, not a launch);
  `left_to_pumpfun_lane` (a pump.fun bonding curve: that lane hears it from the program's logs
  with its own gates and canary); `notice_stale` (first seen more than 5 minutes after it was
  created, or undated); already held or already judged; `stock_not_listed`;
  `stock_canary_blocked`.
- *one account read:* `mint_refused` — the executor's `auditMintAccount` on the **new token**
  (plus a live mint or freeze authority), never on the stock, whose permanent delegate and
  pause switch the audit refuses; the live GAYMF token in the fixture is refused here for
  its TransferFee extension. `stock_unpayable` — the stock described (paused, a live
  transfer hook, a symbol that is not the listed one) and its ticket checked by the
  executor's `quoteTicketFor`. `daily_capacity`, `daily_capacity_sol`, and the fee and rent
  caps through the executor's `assertNetworkFeeBudget`.
- *Jupiter:* `no_route` (Jupiter cannot price it — the brand-new pump.fun curve quoted in GLDx
  answered `TOKEN_NOT_TRADABLE`), `quote_mismatch`, `route_not_direct`, `impact_over_cap`,
  `no_exit_route` (it cannot price the way back), `round_trip_over_cap`.

A pool that clears opens a would-have position. In an armed lane the entry rule is the
pump.fun lane's: after 10 s it must still mark at or above its would-have fill, the mark
being Jupiter's quote to sell it straight back. Exits are the same determiner (1.5× take,
stop, 90 s stall, 180 s time stop, the hold clock), sold back through Jupiter.

**The check before anything is signed.** Jupiter builds the transaction here, so each one is
decoded and bound before Phantom (or the autopilot wallet) sees it. The check is a port of
the executor's own Jupiter validator: the wallet must be the fee payer and the only signer;
every lookup table is read from **your** RPC, never taken from Jupiter; the only programs
allowed are the compute budget, idempotent creates of the wallet's own account for the two
mints, and one Jupiter `route_v2` whose data must spend **exactly the ticket**, at the
quote's output and slippage (inside the cap), with no fee of its own, from the wallet's own
stock account into its own token account; the priority fee must be inside the lane's. Then
no other token account of the wallet may be writable; then the engine's own simulation must
show the stock paid is exactly the ticket, the tokens delivered at or above the floor, and
SOL moving by the fee and rent only; then neither account may have gained a delegate or a
close authority. A transaction that spends from another account, changes the amount, sends
the output elsewhere, adds a transfer or a signer, or hides an account behind a lookup
table is refused **before signing**, by name (`transaction_refused`, `simulation_refused`).
The fill is then read from the transaction's own balances, as for pump.fun.

**The canary, for this venue.** The first live buy here in each stock is that stock's
canary size (`minPerTrade`); the full ticket only after one Jupiter fill in it has been read
back off the chain. A buy that was sent and cannot be read back or booked blocks that stock
in this venue until you check the signature and press *clear the block* in the Venues card.

**What is not measured.** Nothing about these pools has been measured by this lane: no win
rate, no follow-through, no fill. HAWK-AI's record is pump.fun launches paid in SOL. The
feeds see a pool a minute or more after it is created, so the 10 s wait runs from first
sight, not from creation. Keyless Jupiter answers about one request every two seconds,
shared by every quote and mark, so marks are seconds apart and would-have rows beyond two
are recorded, not marked. On the one pool read while this was built (GAYMF / GLDx, Raydium
CPMM, 0.01 GLDx) a round trip through Jupiter returned 899,767 of 1,000,000 raw GLDx — about
10% before network fees, which the follow-through rule then has to clear. Jupiter's own
program and the pool's program still run inside the swap: the check above bounds what the
wallet can lose to them in the simulation, not what those programs are. Jupiter calls
`/swap/v1` "no longer actively maintained" and names a successor; no sunset date is
published.

### Who signs: Phantom per trade, or autopilot

**Phantom per trade** is the default. Phantom has no auto-approve, and this mode does not
route around it: a buy the lane clears becomes one Phantom window on the console tab; a
sell the exit rules order becomes one Phantom window. The extension never sees a key.
Close the console tab and the lane cannot sign; a stop that needs a click is a weaker
stop than a key's.

**Autopilot** trades without asking. In the popup's *Who signs* card:

1. **Create** the autopilot wallet: a passphrase of at least 12 characters, typed twice.
   The extension generates a keypair and stores its 64-byte secret as AES-GCM-256
   ciphertext under a key PBKDF2-SHA256 derives from your passphrase (600,000 iterations,
   a fresh salt and nonce every write), in `chrome.storage.local`. The passphrase is never
   stored. There is no reset: write it down somewhere that is not this browser.
2. **Fund from Phantom**: an amount you type (default: your daily budget), or a listed
   stock. The extension builds the transfer, simulates it, and asks Phantom **once**, on
   the console tab.
3. **Unlock** for a while (8 hours by default; 5 minutes to 24 hours, set in Options). The
   decrypted key then sits in `chrome.storage.session` — memory only, readable by the
   extension's own pages and worker, gone when the browser closes — until the unlock runs
   out. **Lock** removes it at once.
4. **Arm**: the sentence you type names the autopilot wallet's address and ends *"signed
   without asking me, by the autopilot key this browser holds"*. A sentence typed for
   Phantom cannot arm autopilot. The checklist adds three items: the wallet exists, it is
   unlocked, and it holds enough for one buy (the ticket, the buy's fee and rent, one
   sell's fee, and the 0.00089088 SOL rent floor).
5. **Sweep back**: every token it holds (by `TransferChecked`, each emptied account closed
   for its rent), every empty token account closed, then all SOL above the rent floor — to
   your Phantom wallet, signed by the autopilot wallet. Refused while it holds a live
   position (the position would have no SOL left to sell with).
6. **Export** is for recovery: with the passphrase, the key is shown once in the base58
   form Phantom imports. After exporting, treat the wallet as exposed: sweep it and
   **Replace** it (the popup does this only for a swept wallet holding no position, and
   only with its current passphrase).

What is true on autopilot, plainly:

- **A key in a browser is a bigger attack surface than Phantom.** While the wallet is
  unlocked, anything that can read the extension's session storage — malware on the
  machine, a debugger attached to the worker, a hostile extension — can read the key and
  spend what the wallet holds. A keylogger has the passphrase.
- **Your exposure is what you fund it with.** The budget is enforced twice: by the day cap,
  as always, and by the balance — a buy the wallet cannot cover is refused by name before
  anything is signed (`autopilot_balance_short`), and were that check wrong, the chain
  would refuse the spend.
- **Locking clears the unlocked key; a locked wallet signs nothing** — including sells. An
  unlock that runs out locks itself and says so; a position the locked wallet holds waits,
  with a notification, until you unlock it.
- **A sell is always signed by the wallet that holds the position**, whatever the signer
  setting says now, so switching modes never strands one. A curve that graduates must be
  sold by hand: Forget the row, Sweep back, and sell it in Phantom.
- **The console tab is not needed to trade on autopilot** (only to fund). The worker is
  kept awake by the feed's socket and the half-minute keepalive alarm.
- **Unmeasured:** no autopilot trade, fund or sweep has been made on mainnet. The path is
  proven against the scripted chains in the tests below and nowhere else. Autopilot
  changes who signs, not what is bought: the record below still loses.

`docs/session-wallet.md` has the threat model.

### What it refuses, and what you must know

- **A stop that needs a click is a weaker stop than a key's.** In Phantom mode every exit is one Phantom
  window. A declined sell is asked again 8 s later, and an unanswered window is abandoned
  after 32 s and asked again, for as long as the determiner still says sell; the lane
  fires a notification and puts SELL on the badge. It cannot press Approve for you.
- **In Phantom mode, close the console tab and the lane loses its signer.** Open
  positions are still yours, and still priced, but nothing can be sold until it is back.
  On autopilot the tab is needed only to fund; a locked autopilot wallet is the same stop.
- **A buy window that sits past 25 s is abandoned.** A declined buy is never re-asked.
- **One live position at a time** by default, on either signer.
- **Never a coin you launched.** A new coin whose creator is one of this browser's own wallets
  (the autopilot wallet, so every CashCat launch, or the connected Phantom wallet), as the notice
  names it or as its bonding curve records it, is refused at `own_coin` before any gate and
  never opened, on paper or live (`test-cats-cashcat.mjs`).
- **The checklist is the condition.** The sentence alone does not arm: every item the popup
  lists under "Before this lane may spend money" must be green (a stock listed with no stop
  chosen, for one, keeps the lane unarmed with the sentence typed).
- **A curve that has graduated to a pool cannot be sold by this lane** — it sells on the
  curve only. The row says SELL BY HAND; sell it yourself, then press **Forget**.
- **The manifest is the charter.** Permissions are `storage`, `alarms`, `notifications`;
  the content script matches the console pages only; `injected.js` is the only
  web-accessible resource. Widening any of it (beyond `unlimitedStorage`, which the test
  tolerates) fails `test-hawk-manifest.mjs`. The xStock venue added no permission: its
  requests to api.jup.ag, api.geckoterminal.com and api.dexscreener.com (and datapi.jup.ag if
  you choose that feed) are fetches under the same https host permission the RPC uses.
- **Exactly one file may hold a key, and only on autopilot.** In Phantom mode the
  extension holds no key at all. On autopilot the key lives in `src/lib/session-wallet.mjs`
  and nowhere else: `test-hawk-no-key.mjs` scans every source file on every run, and the
  built bundle in `dist/` whenever one is present (build first, then `npm test`), for a
  Keypair, a secret, a derivation or a signer outside that file; pins that only the
  service worker imports it; that the unlocked key goes to session storage only; that
  only the create, unlock and export messages carry a passphrase and only the export
  returns a key; that no message carries transaction bytes from a page; and that nothing
  logs or stores either. `test-hawk-autopilot.mjs` checks the same through the running
  worker. Either way, the engine refuses to send any signed transaction whose message is
  not the one it asked to have signed.
- **Two RPCs are optional here; on the executor they are mandatory.** A single provider
  is a single witness; the shadow row's `endpointVerdict` says `single` when so.

## Downloads and releases

The site's [Downloads page](https://catintelligenceagency.com/downloads/) serves the extension
ready to load, with a plain install guide for Chrome, Brave and Edge, and all seven cats' art.
It is not in the Chrome Web Store yet; the kit for submitting it is in
[docs/chrome-web-store/](docs/chrome-web-store/README.md).

- **The zips are built at deploy, never committed.** After the floor-data overlay, `pages.yml`
  runs `npm run build` and `node scripts/package.mjs`, which writes
  `site/downloads/cat-intelligence-agency-extension.zip` (`dist/` with `manifest.json` at the
  zip's root and an `INSTALL.txt`, no source maps) and `site/downloads/cia-cats.zip` (each cat's
  sprite, 400 avatar and 1024 art, the banners, the $CIA logo and a README), and puts their sizes
  and SHA-256s in `site/assets/downloads-data.js`, which the page reads as a script. The site's
  tests then check the page against those files. If the build or the packaging fails, the deploy
  fails and the live site stays as it was.
- **The same commit gives the same bytes.** The zips are written by a small zip writer with no
  dependencies (`scripts/zip.mjs`): sorted entries, every date 1980-01-01, text deflated by
  `node:zlib`, pictures stored. `test-downloads.mjs` builds and packages twice and compares.
- **Locally:** `npm run build && node scripts/package.mjs` fills `site/` as a deploy would;
  `node scripts/package.mjs --placeholder` puts the committed placeholder back before a commit
  (`test-site.mjs` fails on a data file that names zips that are not there).
- **Proof that it loads:** `node scripts/verify-download.mjs` unzips the packaged zip, loads it
  in Chromium the way Load unpacked does, opens the popup, the options page and the setup page,
  and fails on any console error, uncaught error or entry in Chrome's error list for it. It also
  checks what the page says about updating and removing: the folder replaced in place and
  reloaded keeps the extension's ID and settings, another folder gets a new ID and none, and
  removing it deletes them. It needs Playwright and a Chromium, so it is not part of `npm test`.
- **Releases:** push a tag `v<version>` (the version `manifest.json` and `package.json` both
  carry, e.g. `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`). `release.yml` runs the suite, builds,
  packages and attaches both zips and `SHA256SUMS.txt` to the tag's GitHub Release. A tag that is
  not the manifest's version fails before anything is published.

## Install

**Download it.** The site's [Downloads page](https://catintelligenceagency.com/downloads/) serves
`cat-intelligence-agency-extension.zip`, built from main at every deploy, with its version, size
and SHA-256 (each tagged version is also on the
[releases page](https://github.com/gtjvv976mb-netizen/Cat-Intelligence-Agency/releases)). Check
the SHA-256, unzip it somewhere it can stay, then `chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** →
**Load unpacked** → the unzipped folder (the one with `manifest.json` in it). The page has the
same steps for Brave and Edge, and how to update it and remove it.

**Or build it from the source**, with Node.js 22.13 to 24, and read what you build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gtjvv976mb-netizen/Cat-Intelligence-Agency
cd Cat-Intelligence-Agency && npm ci && npm run build      # → dist/
```

then load `Cat-Intelligence-Agency/dist` the same way; it is the folder the zip holds. Either way
the extension is **Cat Intelligence Agency**, with CoinMarketCat, Snipurr, Popcat, CashCat and
Crying Cat inside.

**Popcat and Crying Cat** need only an RPC (below): the public mainnet RPC answers 403 to the
extension. **CashCat** needs the autopilot wallet
(created, funded and unlocked in the popup), an RPC, and your Pinata JWT in **Options →
CashCat**; drafting from a trend and auto mode need your Anthropic key too.

**The agent.** Open **Options** (the popup's *Options* link, or the agent card's *Set up the
agent*). In **The agent**: name it, write the strategy, tick the tokens (or add a custom mint
— that needs an RPC, below), choose the settlement token and the schedule, set the limits,
paste your Anthropic API key and press **Save key**, press **Load the list** and pick a model
(or keep the newest), and **Save the agent**. In the popup's **Agent** tab press **Start on
paper**. Read the journal. To go live: set an RPC (below), create, fund (USDC or USDT, at
least $50, and a little SOL) and unlock the autopilot wallet in the popup, switch the mode to
Live in Options, then type the sentence the agent card prints and press **Start LIVE**.

**Snipurr and the wallet.** The rest of this section is the setup page that opens on install,
which sets up Snipurr's lane and the parts both lanes share.

1. The setup page opens on install: connect, pick a style, set your limits, choose stocks and who
   signs, and save — which puts the lane in **Observe**. Everything it sets stays editable
   in Options, and the popup's *Setup* link opens it again. The styles: **Balanced** is
   the lane's own defaults (the record's 1.5× take, 90 s stall and 180 s time stop at the
   executor's 0.005 SOL canary, 0.01 SOL a day); **Cautious** is no looser on any dial and
   tighter on three (one canary a day, 60 s stall, 120 s time stop — a choice, not a
   measured improvement); **Bold** is labelled *looser than the record supports* (0.05 SOL
   a ticket, 0.25 SOL a day, 2× take, 120 s stall, 300 s time stop, a proposed 0.5× stop).
   Every style keeps the 10 s wait and the ≥ 1.0× follow-through. The stock checklist
   offers GLDx, TSLAx and SPYx (read from the vendored fixture) and AAPLx and NVDAx (read
   over RPC on 2026-09-24, not in the fixture); a ticked stock is written into the same
   stock list Options edits, in that stock's own units.
2. Open the extension's **Options** and paste an RPC URL (the setup page asks for it too) (Helius, Triton, QuickNode). The
   public mainnet RPC refuses browsers. A second RPC is optional; with one set, a curve
   the two disagree on is not trusted, and a read one of them missed or failed is used
   alone (the shadow row's `endpointVerdict` says `single` or `one_missing`).
3. Open the console page — the popup's **Console** button opens
   `https://catintelligenceagency.com/console/` — and press **Connect Phantom**.
   Phantom injects its provider into web pages only, so signing happens in that tab.
   **Keep it open.**
4. In the popup's **Snipurr** tab choose **Observe**. Watch the shadow book fill. Export it, grade it.
5. To arm: choose **Execute**, read the checklist, type the sentence the lane prints for
   the wallet that will sign (Phantom's, or the autopilot wallet's), press **Arm**. It is compared byte for byte, as WALL-ST-E does
   with `SNIPE_LIVE_ACK`. A ticket above the 0.005 SOL canary must also have a stop you
   chose.

`npm run watch` rebuilds on save; press the reload arrow on the extension card afterwards.

What a buy is, end to end: the feed's `logsSubscribe` notice → `noticesFromLogs` (the
venue's own parser) → one `getMultipleAccounts` (curve, Global, mint) → `snipeContract`
in observe mode → a would-have position and a shadow row → the wait → a fresh read →
`planSnipeCeiling` → `buyIx` → `snipeContract` in execute mode, which decodes the bytes
back and matches them to the plan → a v0 transaction (compute budget, idempotent ATA
create, `buy_v2`) → **simulated on your RPC with a spend ceiling and a delivery floor** →
one Phantom window → the signed bytes are checked to be the same message → sent with
preflight skipped → confirmed → the fill read from the transaction's own balances →
booked, charged to the rolling day. A sell is the same path with `sell_v2`.

A buy in the xStock venue: a feed's pool → the gates above → one `getMultipleAccounts` (the
new token, audited; the stock, described) → Jupiter's quote in and quote back out → a
would-have position → the wait → the same again, fresh → Jupiter's transaction → decoded and
bound, lookup tables from your RPC → the wallet's other accounts proved untouched → the
engine's simulate guard → one Phantom window (or the autopilot key) → the same-message check →
sent → confirmed → the fill read from the transaction → booked in the stock.

## Keeping the decision code honest

```bash
npm run check-upstream                          # does vendor/executor still match Claude-Company main?
node scripts/sync-executor.mjs --from ../Claude-Company   # re-vendor from a checkout, record its commit
```

`test-vendor-integrity.mjs` refuses a vendored file whose bytes do not match the
manifest, so a hand edit under `vendor/` fails the suite by name. CI runs the drift check
on every push to `main`.

## Tests

`npm test` runs every `test-*.mjs` at the root and under `vendor/executor/`:

| file | proves |
|---|---|
| `test-agent-strategy.mjs` | the agent's spec: every preset mint re-derived from the recorded mainnet bytes and Jupiter's token list; the defaults; every refusal by name (SOL, the settlement token, an unverified mint, eleven tokens, each limit's fence); the pair allowlist; the arm sentence binding every limit and token |
| `test-agent-market.mjs` | the snapshot replayed from the recorded DexScreener, GeckoTerminal and Jupiter answers: the parsers, missing stays missing, the indicators worked by hand and cross-checked on the live candles, one request per tick, candles only when asked and 2.1 s apart, a 429 resting the host and doubling, Jupiter pricing only what DexScreener did not |
| `test-agent-brain.mjs` | the brain against a scripted Anthropic API with invented model ids: the request and its headers, the model list and the default, the decision format held exactly, 401/403/429/500/529/400, a refusal, a truncated answer, no tool call, the retry when a forced tool choice is refused, usage, and the key in one header to one origin |
| `test-agent-risk.mjs` | the hard limits clause by clause: the UTC day, valuation with stale and unpriced marks, the stop and take at their edges, the breaker tripping, holding and resetting at UTC midnight, liquidate, every clamp in order, every refusal clause produced, and no limit the model can move |
| `test-agent-runner.mjs` | the agent end to end: paper against scripted feeds, Jupiter and the model — decisions, clamps, fills, the take and stop between turns, the model failing, the breaker, pause, liquidate, stop, the journal cap, a restart; then live on a chain double with the real engine's fences and the real autopilot wallet — arming, a checked and signed buy read back from the chain, five hostile transactions refused before signing, a live take profit, a locked wallet; and the pair allowlist on Jupiter's recorded live transaction; one hop through SOL on Jupiter's recorded live USDC → MEW and USDC → KITTY transactions, both ways, and every hostile edit of them refused by name (a second or a non-SOL intermediate, a split, the output redirected, wrapped SOL left in the wallet, the wallet's SOL spent as input, the route not matching the quote); a paper MEW buy through SOL; a live KITTY hop bought and sold back on the chain double with no wrapped SOL left in the wallet; then the money paths under failure — Liquidate all retrying what it could not sell, a live buy with no readable outcome pausing the agent, a worker dying mid-tick or mid-swap, a withdrawal and a deposit moving the breaker's base, and Pause pressed while the model decides |
| `test-agent-no-leak.mjs` | the API key: the AGENT messages, where the key is read, the password field that is cleared, the running worker (the key only ever to api.anthropic.com, never stored elsewhere, logged or answered), the bundles, the site; and no model identifier in any file or commit message |
| `test-hawk-engine.mjs` | Snipurr's lane end to end against a scripted chain that executes the venue's own `buy_v2`/`sell_v2` and a scripted Phantom: notice → shadow row → the wait → re-read → sign → fill → 1.5× take → declined sell re-asked → approved sell closes with the chain's SOL; a launch nobody followed is never bought; a declined or unanswered buy; a tampered signature refused; the day cap; the hard stop; the JSONL export read back and scored. Then a GLDx-quoted curve built from the live fixture bytes: refused when GLDx is not listed; read on the same call and filed in GLDx when it is; the canary buy with the GLDx account created under Token-2022, simulated on the GLDx delta, read back in eight decimals; the sell for GLDx; the full ticket once proven; the per-stock day cap and the SOL day; a short wallet, a paused stock, a buy that cannot be read back; SOL and GLDx graded apart; the stock list's validation and the arm sentence; the fill reader alone |
| `test-hawk-engine.mjs` §18 | autopilot with the real session wallet (a keystore over Maps, `createSessionSigner`): locked it does not arm; unlocked and funded it arms on the autopilot sentence; the buy and the sell reaching the chain carry ed25519 signatures by the autopilot key and Phantom is asked nothing; the key reaches no log, notification or store; a wallet short of one buy does not arm, and one that fell short since the last read is refused at `autopilot_balance_short`; switching to Phantom never strands a position; locked, a sell waits and says so; an unlock that runs out disarms |
| `test-hawk-autopilot.mjs` | the running service worker under a `chrome` double and a JSON-RPC chain double that verifies every signature and applies the rent rule: install opens the setup page once; the three styles against the defaults dial by dial; only extension pages drive the wallet; create, fund (one Phantom approval, SOL and GLDx by TransferChecked), unlock with a TTL and its alarm, export, sweep to exactly the rent floor with every token and empty account, lock, an unlock that runs out; nothing logged or stored carries the passphrase or the key; no sweep while a position is held |
| `test-hawk-session-wallet.mjs` | the keystore, the signer and the builders in isolation, including why a token sweep is TransferChecked: Token-2022 refuses a plain Transfer out of an xStock's pausable, hooked account |
| `test-hawk-manifest.mjs` | the permissions, matches and resources above; the name (Cat Intelligence Agency) and the description naming the five cats; the agency's icons; the setup page is built, not web-accessible, opened only on install and names the five cats; every host permission's reason, in build.mjs and word for word in this README, and every fixed host the cats call listed with who calls it and why |
| `test-hawk-no-key.mjs` | one file may hold a key and only the worker imports it; a CashCat launch's mint key made, used once and dropped there, in memory only, handed by the worker to CashCat's tab alone, which reaches a signature only after the bot's pre-sign check and a simulation of the same bytes; Popcat and Crying Cat sign nothing; the files of bots/ the bundles import hold no key; the agent's files name only their hosts, sign nothing and never reach the sweep, and its runner signs only through the engine's fences, after its own check; the autopilot messages, the passphrase and the exported key pinned to where they may appear; the xStock venue's code names only its four hosts, sends Jupiter the wallet's public key and nothing else of it, and reaches a signature only through the engine's `signSendConfirm`, each call after its own pre-sign check; in source and in the bundle |
| `test-hawk-xstock-venue.mjs` | the second venue against a chain double that runs Jupiter's `route_v2` on a constant-product pool, a scripted Jupiter and scripted feeds, no network: the venue off by default and silent; the captured GeckoTerminal and DexScreener pages parsed and classified; the poller's backoff on the captured 429, dedupe and horizon; the Jupiter client's rate budget; the quote and transaction checks on the **live** GLDx → GAYMF bytes and every hostile edit of them; observe with each gate refusing by name; armed on Phantom: wait, follow-through, buy, 1.5× take, sell, booked in GLDx; ten hostile Jupiter transactions and two hostile pools refused before signing; the canary, full ticket, day caps and a short wallet; an unreadable buy blocking the stock; autopilot signing with nothing secret on the wire; the pump.fun lane unchanged |
| `test-hawk-bundle.mjs` | the shims agree with what they replace; the build succeeds; every entry parses with no `node:` specifier; the bundled contract refuses a stale notice at the same gate the vendored contract does; the bundled agent limits decide exactly as their source; the five sprites and CashCat's art and font copied byte for byte; the size budgets (the build under 12 MB, the art under 7 MB, each bundle under its cap); the bundled content rules, trend check (the long given-name list included) and Crying Cat's input decide exactly as their source |
| `test-cats-popcat.mjs` | Popcat's tab on the two recorded cat coins and coins added to be refused: the list and all twelve checks, the verdicts as the bot finds them, a red flag in the floor's words; text only (no picture, no link but pump.fun's and Solscan's, the popup never assigning innerHTML); the user's CashCat coins never listed, by mint, wallet or the creator the curve records; one step at a time, two coins a step, twenty seconds apart, a 429 resting and doubling, the public RPC's 403 resting half an hour, no RPC checking nothing; a young coin waiting; no trading code |
| `test-cats-crying.mjs` | Crying Cat's input refused but for an address or a pump.fun coin link of that exact form; the report on the recorded coins (authorities, extensions, holders without the curve and pools, the creator's share, the curve, copycats) with plain words and only Solscan and pump.fun links; a live mint or freeze authority, a transfer fee, a creator's 10% as red flags; a wallet, a token account or nothing said to be one; a token too big to list read from its 20 largest accounts |
| `test-cats-cashcat.mjs` | CashCat in the extension against the recorded trends and Jupiter list, a scripted Anthropic API with invented model ids, a scripted Pinata, a chain double that verifies every signature, the real autopilot wallet and the real engine's fences: the settings' fences (no dev buy by default, at most 0.05 SOL, at most 2 a day); drafts refused by the content rules, each by name, and the model's review; a trend draft with the model picked from `GET /v1/models`; the logo's layout, and the extension's renderer drawing the bot's logo pixel for pixel with each sign measured as recorded; a launch checked, simulated, pinned, signed by the new mint and the autopilot wallet and sent once, passing the bot's pre-sign check, with the user's disclosure and no claim of the agency; every refusal before a signature; the mint's key made, used once and dropped, nothing key-shaped left in storage; the dev buy as a checked second transaction; auto mode's sentence, checklist, schedule, day cap, minimum balance, no dev buy, and never a buy or a sell |
| `test-cats-no-leak.mjs` | the cats' message tables; the Pinata JWT pinned in the source (one storage key, read in the worker's reader, save and clear only, handed to pinMetadata alone, a password field cleared at once), through the running worker — a whole launch with the logo drawn in the worker, and every request carrying the JWT to Pinata's upload API only, in one header, and nothing stored, logged, notified or answered carrying it — and in the bundles |
| `test-cats-browser.mjs` | the built extension loaded in Chromium: the popup and Options opened, every tab clicked, no console or page error, the worker's logo drawn in the real browser; skips cleanly where no Chromium or Playwright is installed |
| `test-vendor-integrity.mjs` | every vendored module hashes to the manifest, from a named upstream commit |
| `test-bots-content.mjs` | the content rules clause by clause: real people (by name and by the "Firstname Lastname" shape), brands and teams, endorsement and "official" claims, tragedy, minors, sex, hate (slurs by salted hash only), identity, financial promises, the formats; compounds caught without their false friends, look-alike digits read as letters, and the evasions: Cyrillic and Greek look-alikes, small capitals, invisible characters inside a word, letters spelt out one by one, a listed word split in two, nickname endings, a web address in a name; the trend gate on the recorded Google Trends and CoinGecko answers; the cat-word detector and its false friends (catch, category, scatter, muscat…) |
| `test-bots-validators.mjs` | `launches.js` and `callouts.js`: every refusal (HTML, hidden characters (the soft hyphen and word joiners too), a link scheme in text, a bad address or signature (base58 that does not decode to 32 or 64 bytes too), an unknown field, an impossible time, a wrong venue, ticker or kitten, a dev buy over 0.05 SOL or without its transaction, a missing or repeated check, an "info" from a source never silent, stats that are not counts, a coin or a pick of CashCat's); a failed check listed as a red flag, not refused; every malformed pick (a window off the six-hour grid, a time outside it, checks too old, a draft too long, without its disclosure, not opening with its coin or saying "buy", a second pick for a window or a coin, a pick of a spotted coin); links only to Solscan, pump.fun and StonkFun; the data module newest first, one entry per coin, capped at 200 coins and 28 picks and validated whole; Popcat's queue read back only when well formed |
| `test-bots-data.mjs` | the data the site is about to publish (run by every deploy after the overlay): every entry and pick passes, none is CashCat's, Popcat's memory is not published |
| `test-bots-pumpfun.mjs` | the pump.fun builders against eleven recorded `create_v2` transactions (every account re-derived), the live Global account, the recorded `collect_creator_fee`, Custom Pairs, and the recorded simulation |
| `test-bots-stonkfun.mjs` | the LaunchLab builders against six recorded StonkFun launches, the platform configs and curve rules, StonkFun's recorded API answers, and the recorded simulation |
| `test-bots-txcheck.mjs` | the pre-sign checks: each venue's planned launch passes; every hostile edit (a transfer out, a token transfer, a memo, an extra signer, another fee payer, a third compute-budget instruction, a swapped account, another creator, a flag, another name or URI, StonkFun's other platform, another raise, vesting, a transfer fee) is refused by name before a signature; the simulation must succeed, log the right instruction and stay inside the budget |
| `test-bots-cashcat.mjs` | CashCat end to end against the recorded trend and Jupiter answers, a scripted Anthropic API with invented model ids, a scripted Pinata and a chain double: the model picked from `GET /v1/models`; the caps, fences and every live guard by name; a dry run builds, checks and simulates and uploads, signs, sends and writes nothing; a live run missing any guard sends nothing; a green live run pins and reads back, sends one checked transaction whose signatures verify, reads it back and records a launch the site validates, with the disclosure; a coin whose record the site would refuse is never sent; the fee claim waits for the wallet, its address, the RPC and the switch; an unrecorded launch is found behind dust sent to the wallet and from yesterday's last run, and an unreadable day refuses; no secret in a log; the ticker check; the invention loop and a review held to its format |
| `test-bots-popcat.mjs` | Popcat replayed on two real cat coins recorded on 2026-09-24 (one passing every check, one failing three); every threshold at its edge, and the site's plain words for each red flag pinned to the same numbers; the CashCat exclusion by the creator the bonding curve records; same-slot transactions it could not read counted; a creation found on an exact page of 1,000; copycats against the established cat coins; whole runs on a scripted pump.fun and chain: a dry run writes nothing, a live run publishes both coins, the failing one as spotted with its red flags named, a coin from CashCat's wallet, in its launches or named by its curve on chain is never listed, a name carrying a web address is never printed and is counted as skipped, a coin whose accounts do not decode is dropped by name; then synthetic coins on a listing only so deep: runs every fifteen minutes with one skipped and no cat coin missed, two skipped and the stretch named, the budget with its leftovers named and checked next run, a failed read tried again; the pick: one per window, none when no coin is clean, a deterministic tie-break, never the same coin twice, drafts within 200 characters with no price, promise or "buy"; and the job summary against hostile coin names |
| `test-bots-logo.mjs` | the logo: the eight kittens, each sign's rectangle re-measured from the pixels, Press Start 2P shipped unmodified with its licence, and a rendered 1024 × 1024 logo with the ticker's ink inside the sign |
| `test-bots-no-leak.mjs` | one file under `bots/` may hold a key and Popcat holds none; the wallet gives out its address and signatures, never its secret; the logger redacts every secret; no host but the allowed ones, no plain http; no model identifier anywhere in the bots, their fixtures, workflows or data; the runner blanks every bot secret and switch |
| `test-bots-workflows.mjs` | the workflows: schedules (Popcat every fifteen minutes), CashCat's job in the `cashcat` environment, secrets reaching only their steps, floor-data and the deploy, pinned actions, no stored credentials |
| `test-bots-floor-data.mjs` | the floor-data branch on local repositories: orphan start, a dry run committing nothing, pushes that race, Popcat's memory deploying nothing; the deploy's overlay carrying Popcat's picks, leaving out and naming a bad entry, retrying a transient API error, and failing (never blanking the floor) when the data cannot be read or is the wrong shape |
| `test-site.mjs` | the website: the work floor (the 3D building and the hero lead to it, a kitten always wins the click over the building, seven stations for the seven cats, each hotspot on its own desk, each station with its sprite, screen, copy and an honest empty state, Snipurr's and CoinMarketCat's linking to the extension's page and the console; `cases.json` parses, fits the schema and holds `POSTED_CASES` entries, none invented; the shared validator refuses an unknown agent, an impossible date, a `javascript:` link and HTML; every floor picture a web-sized copy from `brand/floor/`; the page under 2.5 MB); every dial and record figure it quotes read from the code that decides it; the console still the bridge (protocol.mjs's channel and types, its own origin, every element it draws); no page that signs, collects, stores beyond the theme or calls out; three.js self-hosted and byte for byte 0.169.0, every file the 3D scene loads present, the roster picture as its fallback, the home page under 3.5 MB; the seven cards, CashCat and Popcat marked as bots with their status read from their own files; the bots' desks and the feed reading `launches.json` and `callouts.json` through the deploy's validators, text only, no coin's picture, links only to Solscan, pump.fun and StonkFun, spotted coins never called callouts and kept out of the feed, Popcat's pick on top with a draft to copy by hand and never the clipboard, its disclosure the same words everywhere, and the numbers the bot cards quote read from the bots' code; every placeholder from one config and empty until it exists; the two-line disclaimer, $CIA as the only use of the initials, no government imagery in any image description; no hype, no invented counts; titles, descriptions, og tags on the domain, the kit's favicons and every local link |
| `test-downloads.mjs` | the downloads, with no browser: two builds packaged twice give the same bytes; the extension zip holds `manifest.json` at its root with this manifest's name and version, every built file and nothing else, no source map, and an `INSTALL.txt` with the steps; the system's `unzip` agrees; the cats pack holds all seven cats' three pictures byte for byte from `brand/`, the banners, the logo and a README that names each cat and claims no licence; the data file's numbers are the zips'; unsafe names, a missing manifest and a tag that is not the manifest's version are refused; the deploy packages before the site's tests, and the release attaches both zips with `contents: write` only |
| `vendor/executor/test-snipe-stall-default.mjs` | the executor's stall-default fix, as vendored |
| `vendor/executor/test-snipe-quote-mint.mjs` | the executor's stock-quote contract, as vendored: the allowlist, `quoteTicketFor`, `describeMint` on the live xStock bytes, the book row at eight decimals, one scorecard per quote |

## Not advice

A user-operated tool that runs in your own browser against your own wallet. Nothing here
is financial advice, and nothing here has an edge until you have measured it over a real
sample: the agent's journal on paper, Snipurr's graded shadow book. A model's judgement is
not an edge, and the agent's returns are unmeasured. In Phantom mode every position Snipurr
opens can be sold only by a click you make; on autopilot both lanes sell without asking,
from a wallet that can lose everything you fund it with. CoinMarketCat is not affiliated
