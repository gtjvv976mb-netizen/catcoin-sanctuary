# The session wallet (the autopilot wallet)

*A key the extension makes, funded once from Phantom, that signs on its own and is swept back when you are done.*

The popup calls it the **autopilot wallet**; the code calls it the session wallet. It is
used only when you choose **Autopilot** under *Who signs* (Options, the popup, or the
first-run setup page). With the default, **Phantom per trade**, none of this runs and the
extension holds no key.

A private key in a browser is a bigger attack surface than one on a server. Read that
sentence first; everything below is what the extension does about it and what it cannot.

**Two lanes use it.** Snipurr, the sniper lane, signs from it when *Who signs* is Autopilot.
CoinMarketCat's agent signs from it in **live** mode, and only there: every agent swap is
Jupiter's transaction put through the check before signing (the pair allowlist, the decode,
the simulation), then signed through the engine's `signSendConfirm`, fixed to this wallet.
The agent funds it with USDC or USDT (the popup's *Fund from Phantom* offers the agent's
settlement token), and its **Withdraw** is this wallet's sweep, which only the owner can ask
for. The model the agent consults never sees the key, never names a sweep, and has no path
to one.

## Why it exists

Phantom cannot sign for a bot. The lane as shipped asks Phantom for one approval per
trade, and the README says what that costs: a stop that needs a click is a weaker stop
than a key's, a window that sits is abandoned, a declined sell is asked again. The
executor's record says the clicks come late.

The session wallet is the other answer. The extension generates a keypair, you fund it
from Phantom with **one** approved transfer equal to your budget, the lane signs its
buys and sells from that wallet without asking, and when the session is over the
balance is swept back to Phantom.

The budget becomes the balance. A wallet holding 0.5 SOL cannot spend 0.6 SOL whatever
the lane's arithmetic says, whatever a bug says, whatever a tampered config says — the
chain refuses. That is the hardest cap there is, harder than any check in the engine.

## How it works

Everything lives in `src/lib/session-wallet.mjs`, the one file under `src/` allowed to
touch a secret key. `test-hawk-no-key.mjs` scans every other file for a Keypair, a
secret, a derivation or a signer on every run, and refuses any file but the background
host importing this one.

**At rest.** The 64-byte secret key is AES-GCM-256 ciphertext. The key is derived from
your passphrase by PBKDF2-SHA256, 600,000 iterations, over a 16-byte random salt, with a
12-byte random nonce; both are fresh every time the blob is written. The blob —
`{ v, publicKey, kdf, cipher, ct, createdAt }` — is stored under
`coinmarketcat:session-wallet` in `chrome.storage.local`. It carries the public key in the
clear so the popup can show the address without asking for the passphrase, and nothing a
reader without the passphrase can spend. **The passphrase is never stored**, in any form.
A passphrase must be at least 12 characters.

**Unlocked.** `unlock` decrypts the secret into `chrome.storage.session` — memory only,
extension-private, gone when the browser closes — with an expiry, eight hours by
default. Every read checks the expiry; an expired entry is removed on sight and the
wallet reports locked. `lock` removes it now. Plaintext bytes the module holds are
zeroed after use.

**Signing.** `createSessionSigner` is the same bridge shape the engine already speaks to
Phantom through: `isReady()`, `wallet()`, `signTransaction({ txBase64, wallet })`. A
locked wallet answers `no_wallet`; a transaction for a different wallet than the one the
lane armed on answers `wallet_mismatch`; a transaction that does not name the session
wallet as a signer is refused. The engine's own checks are unchanged: the signed bytes
must carry the message it asked for, the transaction was simulated with a spend ceiling
before it was signed, the day cap and the ticket cap still apply. The wallet's balance is
a cap on top of those, enforced by the chain.

**Replacing.** An existing keystore is never overwritten unless `replace` is asked for
**and** the current passphrase is given. A wallet with funds in it cannot be lost to a
mis-click.

## The ceremony, as the popup runs it

1. **Create** — choose a passphrase of 12 characters or more, typed twice. The extension
   generates the keypair and stores it encrypted. Write the passphrase down somewhere that
   is not the browser; there is no reset. (The setup page can create it too.)
2. **Fund from Phantom** — one transfer, from your Phantom wallet to the autopilot wallet,
   for the amount you type (default: your daily budget) — or, for a stock listed in
   Options, that stock by `TransferChecked` (`buildTokenFundTransaction`). The worker
   builds and simulates it, and Phantom is asked **once**, on the console tab. The
   Phantom wallet that funded it is remembered as where a sweep goes.
3. **Unlock** — type the passphrase and choose how long (the Options default is 480
   minutes; 5 to 1,440). An alarm fires at the expiry: the wallet locks itself, the lane
   says so, and a notification names any position it still holds.
4. **Arm** — the arm sentence names the autopilot wallet's address and ends *"signed
   without asking me, by the autopilot key this browser holds"*; a sentence typed for
   Phantom does not match. The checklist replaces "console tab open" and "Phantom
   connected" with "created", "unlocked" and "funded": the balance must cover one buy —
   the ticket, the modelled fee and rent, one sell's fee, and the 890,880-lamport floor.
   Every buy then reads the balance again at the moment of asking and is refused
   (`autopilot_balance_short`) if it cannot cover that, before anything is signed.
5. **Sweep back** — every token the wallet holds goes to Phantom by `TransferChecked`,
   each emptied account closed so its rent comes back (`closeSource`); every empty token
   account left by past trades is closed, eight to a transaction
   (`buildCloseTokenAccountsTransaction`); then the SOL above the 890,880-lamport floor,
   to the lamport — the fee is computed from the compute budget, not guessed. Every sweep
   transaction is signed by the autopilot wallet; Phantom is asked nothing. The sweep is
   refused while the wallet holds a live position (the position would have no SOL to sell
   with), while it is locked, or to any address but the one the popup showed you. A paused
   stock or a mint with a live transfer hook is skipped and named.
6. **Lock** — when you are done. A locked wallet is ciphertext on disk and a passphrase
   in your head. A position it holds waits, loudly, until you unlock it.

A token transfer is `TransferChecked` (12), never the plain `Transfer` (3): Token-2022
refuses a plain Transfer out of any account carrying the `PausableAccount` or
`TransferHookAccount` extension with `MintRequiredForTransfer`, and every xStock account
carries both (the live 179-byte GLDx account in the vendored fixture does).

## How the extension wires it

- `src/background.mjs` is the only file that imports `session-wallet.mjs`. It builds the
  keystore over `chrome.storage.local` (the sealed blob) and `chrome.storage.session`
  (the unlocked key; its access level pinned to trusted contexts), and refreshes the
  signer when the worker starts and after every keystore call.
- The engine is handed both signers. `signerMode` picks which one **buys**; a **sell** is
  signed by whichever wallet holds the position, so switching modes never strands one.
- The popup, Options and the setup page drive it through the `AUTOPILOT` messages in
  `src/lib/protocol.mjs`. The worker answers them only from the extension's own pages.
  Create, unlock and export carry the passphrase; only export returns a key. No message
  carries transaction bytes: the worker builds every byte it signs or asks Phantom to sign.

## The threat model

What protects against what:

| threat | outcome |
|---|---|
| someone reads `chrome.storage.local` (a backup, a synced profile, a copied disk) | they hold AES-GCM ciphertext; without the passphrase, 600,000 PBKDF2 rounds stand between them and each guess |
| the extension's own bug tries to spend more than the budget | the chain refuses: the wallet does not hold it |
| the lane is armed for one wallet and the session wallet is another | `wallet_mismatch`; nothing is signed |
| the browser closes | the unlocked secret is gone with session storage; the ciphertext remains |
| the session runs past its expiry | the secret is removed on the next read; the lane loses its signer and says so |
| the passphrase is forgotten | the funds are recoverable only if the key was exported; **there is no reset** |

What does **not** protect, said plainly:

- **A compromised browser profile.** Anything that can read the extension's session
  storage while the wallet is unlocked — malware on the machine, a debugger attached to
  the service worker, an extension with the wrong permissions — can read the secret and
  spend everything in the wallet. A keylogger has the passphrase.
- **A malicious build.** You load this extension unpacked: the zip from the site's
  Downloads page, or a build from a repository you cloned. A modified build can do
  anything with the key. Load only a zip whose SHA-256 is the one the Downloads page and
  the version's release print (that says the file is the one the deploy built, not what
  it does), or build it yourself, from a commit you read.
- **The rest of the lane.** The session wallet changes who signs, not what is signed.
  The record the README prints still loses.

Hence the rules: fund it with what you are willing to lose, sweep when the session
ends, lock when done, and never leave a wallet unlocked and funded on a machine you have
walked away from.

## Recovery

Funds are never stranded in a wallet the extension made. `exportSecret` — the popup's
**Export the key (recovery)** — asks for the passphrase and returns the secret key in base58, the form
Phantom and Solflare import (Phantom: *Add / Connect Wallet → Import Private Key*).
Once imported, the wallet is an ordinary wallet in Phantom and you can move anything in
it.

Use it to recover, not to routinely move the key around: a key that is routinely
exported is a key that is routinely exposed. If you export it, treat the session wallet
as burned — sweep it and create a new one.

## The API, for the host

All of it is in `src/lib/session-wallet.mjs`; nothing in it touches `chrome.*`.

```
createKeystore({ storage, session, subtle?, random?, clock? })
  .exists() .publicKey() .create({ passphrase, replace?, currentPassphrase? })
  .unlock({ passphrase, ttlMs? }) .lock() .isUnlocked()
  .changePassphrase({ current, next }) .exportSecret({ passphrase })
  .snapshot() .refresh()
createSessionSigner({ keystore, clock? })      → { isReady(), wallet(), signTransaction(), refresh() }
buildFundTransaction({ from, to, lamports, blockhash, computeUnitLimit?, priorityFeeLamports? })
buildSweepTransaction({ from, to, lamports, blockhash, ... })
sweepableLamports({ balanceLamports, feeLamports?, priorityFeeLamports? })
buildTokenSweepTransaction({ from, to, mint, amountRaw, tokenProgram, decimals, blockhash, ..., transferHook?, closeSource? })
buildTokenFundTransaction({ from, to, mint, amountRaw, tokenProgram, decimals, blockhash, ..., transferHook? })
buildCloseTokenAccountsTransaction({ owner, accounts: [{ address, tokenProgram }], blockhash, ... })   // ≤ 8
SYSTEM_ACCOUNT_RENT_EXEMPT_LAMPORTS = 890880
```

`storage` wraps `chrome.storage.local` and `session` wraps `chrome.storage.session`, each
as `{ get(key) → value | undefined, set(key, value), remove(key) }`. The engine reads
`isReady()` and `wallet()` synchronously, so the signer answers from the keystore's last
read: call `await signer.refresh()` when the worker starts and after every keystore call.
`test-hawk-session-wallet.mjs` runs all of it in Node against a Map;
`test-hawk-engine.mjs` §18 trades with the real signer against a scripted chain; and
`test-hawk-autopilot.mjs` drives create, fund, unlock, export, sweep and lock through
the running service worker.

## What is not measured

No autopilot trade, fund or sweep has been made on mainnet. Everything above is proven
against the scripted chains in the tests and nowhere else. And the autopilot wallet
changes who signs, not what is bought: the record the README prints still loses.
