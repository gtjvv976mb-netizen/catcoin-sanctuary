/**
 * THE DATA THE SITE IS ABOUT TO PUBLISH.
 *
 * Run by every deploy right after bots/floor-data.mjs has overlaid the floor-data branch's
 * launches.json and callouts.json onto site/assets/ (and by the suite, where they are main's
 * empty copies). Whatever their count, every entry must pass the site's own validator with no
 * problem at all, no coin or pick of Popcat's may be one CashCat launched, and nothing a dry run
 * would write may be there: a launch always carries the transaction that made it.
