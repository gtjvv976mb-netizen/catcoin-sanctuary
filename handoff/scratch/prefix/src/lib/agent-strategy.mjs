/**
 * THE AGENT'S SPEC: WHAT THE OWNER WROTE, AND THE LIMITS NOTHING ELSE MAY MOVE.
 *
 * CoinMarketCat's agent trades Solana spot tokens for its owner from a strategy written in
 * plain English. This file is the shape of that agent, and the fence around it:
 *
 *   · A NAME AND A STRATEGY. The strategy is the owner's own words, length-capped, handed
 *     to the model as the strategy to follow. It is not code and it is not a limit: nothing
 *     it says can widen a number below, because the numbers below are read by agent-risk.mjs
 *     and never by the model (agent-brain.mjs shows them to it, read-only).
 *
 *   · A UNIVERSE of at most ten CAT COINS: the "Solana cat coins" preset, other cat coins
 *     added as custom mints, or both. Every preset mint below was read live on 2026-09-25
 *     (see SOLANA_CATS_VERIFIED)
 *     and never typed from memory; a custom mint is read on chain by the worker, over the
 *     owner's RPC, before it can be saved, and its decimals and token program come from
 *     that read. SOL ITSELF IS NOT IN v1. Buying SOL through Jupiter delivers wrapped SOL,
 *     and the check before signing (jupiter-swap.mjs) is a port that dropped the executor's
 *     wrapped-SOL branches: a native-SOL leg would mix the position with the SOL that pays
 *     the network fees, and the fill reader refuses exactly that. So the wrapped-SOL mint is
 *     refused by name (`sol_not_in_v1`). SOL is not a cat coin in any case.
 *
 *   · A SETTLEMENT TOKEN: USDC by default, or USDT. Every buy spends it and every sell
 *     returns it, so every trade is a token-to-token swap — the one kind the existing check
 *     before signing was built and tested for. Cat coins trade against SOL: on 2026-09-25
 *     only POPCAT of the preset had a direct USDC route and none a direct USDT one
 *     (fixtures/agent/jupiter-cat-route-shapes.json), so the route may pass through SOL on
 *     the way: one hop, held in Jupiter's own account, never the wallet's (jupiter-swap.mjs
 *     `solHop`). Both are counted at face value, $1 a unit.
 *
 *   · A SCHEDULE: the model is asked every 15, 30 or 60 minutes. The protections do not
 *     wait for it: stop loss, take profit and the daily drawdown breaker run on the worker's
 *     half-minute alarm, and they run with the model unreachable.
 *
 *   · LIMITS: the most in one token, the most of the vault in tokens, the stop loss, the
 *     take profit, the daily drawdown and what it does when it trips, trades per day, and
 *     the slippage written into every Jupiter instruction. The minimum trade ($10) and the
 *     minimum vault ($50) are CoinMarketCap's Agentic Trading OS numbers and are not dials.
 *
 *   · A MODE: PAPER (the default) fills at Jupiter's quotes and signs nothing; LIVE trades
 *     from the autopilot wallet and arms only with a typed sentence (agentArmSentence) that
 *     names the wallet, the settlement, every limit and every token. Change any of them and
 *     the sentence changes, so a sentence typed for one agent cannot arm another.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network, chrome.* or a key. `normalizeAgentSpec` is the only
 * way a spec is made: the options page runs it before sending, the worker runs it again
 * before storing, and the runner reads nothing else. It refuses the malformed by name.
