/**
 * THE BROWSER LANE'S DIALS, AND THE CHECKLIST THAT ARMS THEM.
 *
 * Every number the entry contract and the exit determiner read is the executor's own —
 * SNIPE_LANE_DEFAULTS from executor/snipe-lane.mjs, imported, never retyped. What this
 * file adds is the handful of dials a browser lane has that a Node process does not: an
 * RPC the user pastes, how long a Phantom approval window may sit open, and how often to
 * ask again for a sell the user has not yet approved.
 *
 * ARMING IS A SENTENCE, AS IT IS ON WALL-ST-E. `snipeArmSentence(wallet, size, cap)` is
 * imported from the lane and compared byte for byte against what the user typed, for the
 * wallet Phantom actually connected. The numbers were typed by a person beside the wallet
 * they bind; a config that was pasted from somewhere cannot arm itself.
 *
 * STOCK QUOTES. pump.fun "Custom Pairs" let a launch be quoted in a token instead of SOL;
 * the ones this lane can be told to pay in are tokenised stocks (xStocks such as GLDx,
 * TSLAx, SPYx). `quoteMints` is the user's list of them, each with its own ticket, day
 * cap and minimum in THAT token's units. Empty — the default — means SOL only, exactly as
 * before. A listed mint is what the lane hands the executor as `quoteMintAllowlist`, and
 * the arm sentence names every listed mint and number, so a sentence typed for SOL alone
 * can never arm a stock trade.
 *
 * WHO SIGNS. `signerMode` is "phantom" (the default: one Phantom approval window per
 * trade, and the extension holds no key) or "autopilot" (the autopilot wallet — the
 * session wallet, the one module the background host imports for it — signs each buy and sell without a
 * window). The arming checklist and the arm sentence follow the mode: an autopilot lane
 * arms only for the autopilot wallet's own address, only while it is unlocked, only while
 * its balance covers a ticket, and only with a sentence that says, in words, that nothing
 * will ask before it signs. A sentence typed for Phantom cannot arm autopilot.
 *
 * THE SECOND VENUE: NEW xSTOCK POOLS, THROUGH JUPITER. `xstockVenue` (off by default)
 * turns on a discovery poll over public new-pool feeds for pools anywhere on Solana that
 * pair a token with an xStock, and a lane that trades them through Jupiter
 * (src/lib/xstock-lane.mjs). It pays in the pool's own stock, from the stock already in
 * the wallet, at that stock's listed ticket, canary and day cap — the same numbers the
 * pump.fun stock lane uses, charged to the same ledger. With no stock listed it watches the
 * built-in list and can only observe. Turning it on appends a clause to the arm sentence,
 * so a lane armed before the venue existed does not start trading it on an old sentence.
