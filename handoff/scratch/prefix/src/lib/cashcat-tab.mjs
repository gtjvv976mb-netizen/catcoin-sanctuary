/**
 * CASHCAT, IN YOUR BROWSER: LAUNCH A CAT COIN OF YOUR OWN ON PUMP.FUN.
 *
 * The agency's CashCat (bots/cashcat/) launches cat coins by itself from GitHub Actions. This is
 * the same machinery, driven by one person from the extension, with every guard the bot has and
 * none loosened. What it reuses, byte for byte:
 *
 *   · the create transaction: bots/cashcat/pumpfun.mjs createV2Ix — pump.fun's create_v2, whose
 *     sixteen accounts were re-derived from eleven real launches (test-bots-pumpfun.mjs);
 *   · the check before any signature: bots/lib/txcheck.mjs checkLaunchMessage, on the COMPILED
 *     v0 message (exactly the payer and the new mint as signers, at most two compute-budget
 *     instructions, one create_v2 whose accounts and decoded arguments are the planned ones: this
 *     coin's name, ticker and metadata URI, the wallet as creator, no option set), then a
 *     simulation that must succeed, log CreateV2 and spend at most the bot's launch budget
 *     (MAX_LAUNCH_SPEND_LAMPORTS, 0.015 SOL) — checkSimulation;
 *   · the metadata: bots/cashcat/metadata.mjs pinMetadata, through the user's own Pinata key,
 *     read back from the public gateway before its URI is written into a transaction, with the
 *     user's document (buildUserDocument): "Not financial advice. Not affiliated with [topic]."
 *     and no claim of the agency; "Made with CashCat." only when the user ticks it (off by default);
 *   · the optional dev buy: the bot's devBuyIxs and checkDevBuyMessage, a separate transaction
 *     after the launch landed, 0 by default, at most 0.05 SOL (FENCES.devBuySol), manual only.
 *
 * WHO SIGNS: THE AUTOPILOT WALLET, ONLY. A create names two signers, the payer and the new mint.
 * The mint's keypair is made, used once and dropped in the autopilot wallet's own module (the
 * one file under src/ that may hold a key, which only the worker imports), handed here as
 * `mintKeys`; its signature is added first, and then the engine's signSendConfirm, bound to the
 * autopilot wallet (engine.agentFences), signs, checks the message is the one that was checked,
 * sends and confirms. Phantom is not offered for CashCat: whether Phantom keeps another signer's
 * signature on a v0 transaction it is asked to sign could not be verified here, and a launch whose
 * mint signature Phantom dropped or whose message it changed would fail or be refused after the
 * user approved it.
 *
 * AUTO MODE (off by default): draft from a trend → the model's review → launch, on a schedule,
 * while Chrome is open, from the autopilot wallet only, armed by a typed sentence that names the
 * wallet and every cap: at most 2 launches a UTC day (every launch from the extension counts),
 * never below the minimum balance, no dev buy, and nothing after a launch — it never buys or
 * sells the coins it launched, from any wallet, and uses no other wallet. Changing a cap, or the
 * wallet, disarms it. A launch whose outcome could not be read disarms it too.
 *
 * THE JOURNAL keeps every launch (its mint, signature, trend or topic, cost) and every refusal,
 * newest first. A launch is written as "sending" BEFORE it is signed, so a worker that dies
 * mid-send still counts it against the day and leaves it for the user to check. Trimming it to
 * JOURNAL_MAX never drops a launch that still blocks the next one or counts against the day.
 *
 * THE SETTINGS are read, changed and written under one lock (withSettings), so a disarm or a cap
 * changed while the alarm's tick reads them is never overwritten by that tick; and an automatic
 * run checks it is still armed, for the same wallet and caps, before it pins and again before
 * anything is signed.
 *
 * StonkFun, and pump.fun coins quoted in a stock, stay the agency's CashCat's for now: this tab
 * launches SOL-quoted pump.fun coins only. Everything is injected; this file touches no chrome.*
 * API and holds no key.
