/**
 * THE OPTIONS PAGE: the agent's spec first, then every config key of Snipurr's lane, each

 *
 * THE AGENT has its own form and its own Save: the spec goes to the worker as
 * AGENT.SAVE_SPEC, and a custom mint is read on chain by the worker before it can be saved.
 * The API key is a password field, sent once with AGENT.SET_API_KEY and cleared from the
 * field at once; the page never gets it back — only whether one is saved. The model list
 * comes from the API with that key (AGENT.LIST_MODELS); with none picked, the agent uses the
 * newest the key lists. Nothing here stores or logs anything: the worker is the only writer.
