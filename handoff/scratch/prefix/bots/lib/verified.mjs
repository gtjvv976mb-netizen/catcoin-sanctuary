/**
 * EVERYTHING THE BOTS RELY ON THAT CAME OFF A LIVE SYSTEM, AND WHERE AND WHEN IT WAS READ.
 *
 * Nothing in this file is recalled or guessed. Each constant below was read off mainnet or a
 * live API on 2026-09-24 (UTC) from this repository's build machine, and the answers the
 * tests replay are recorded under fixtures/bots/. A constant that stops being true breaks a
 * launch at the pre-sign check or at the simulation, never after a signature: the bots
 * re-read every account they build against before they sign (see pumpfun.mjs, stonkfun.mjs).
 *
 * ══ WHAT WAS READ OFF THE LIVE CHAIN ON 2026-09-24 ═════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 *  · pump.fun's program 6EF8rre…F6P publishes its Anchor IDL on chain, in the account
 *    AYgC53tU5BbP2NAnv5nConJxAdpQZctvmZK88pu69xRs (= createWithSeed(PDA([], program),
 *    "anchor:idl", program), derived and read at slot ~450,136,000 through
 *    https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com, 18,938 bytes, zlib). It differs from the copy the
 *    executor vendored on 2026-09-11: create_v2 now takes eight arguments (name, symbol, uri,
 *    creator, is_mayhem_mode, is_cashback_enabled, creator_fee_bps, is_holder_reward) and
 *    still sixteen accounts. The instructions the bots use are kept in
 *    fixtures/bots/pumpfun/idl-subset.json.
 *  · Eleven real create_v2 transactions from the newest coins pump.fun listed that minute
 *    were decoded; every one of their sixteen accounts re-derives from (mint, user) with the
 *    seeds below, 176 of 176 (fixtures/bots/pumpfun/create-v2-samples.json). The
 *    mayhem_token_vault the IDL leaves without seeds is ATA(sol_vault, Token-2022, mint).
 *  · pump.fun's Global account 4wTV1Ymi…jf (1,087 bytes) decodes with the live IDL to:
 *    create_v2_enabled 1, initial virtual reserves 1,073,000,000,000,000 tokens / 30 SOL,
 *    initial real tokens 793,100,000,000,000, creator_fee_configurable 1,
 *    max_configurable_creator_fee_bps 300 (fixtures/bots/pumpfun/global.json).
 *  · A real collect_creator_fee (tx 2fktoQzW…Yficq, slot 449,937,368): five accounts —
 *    creator, creator_vault = PDA(["creator-vault", creator]), system, event authority,
 *    program — signed by the creator alone, and the creator's balance rose by the vault's
 *    lamports (fixtures/bots/pumpfun/collect-creator-fee.json).
 *  · Raydium LaunchLab LanMV9s…3uj publishes its IDL on chain too, in
 *    E6wT2uNeoWUvDrwdch1R8ETsyewR1ZM4WAwsa5hLJK5Z (14,688 bytes; "raydium_launchpad" 0.2.0).
 *  · StonkFun's two LaunchLab platform configs decode (944 bytes each, discriminator
 *    PlatformConfig) with name "StonkFun" and web https://www.stonkfun.xyz, platform fee
 *    rate 10,000 (1%), creator_fee_rate 0, restrict_curve_param 1, and they are the two ids
 *    StonkFun's own pricing endpoint names (fixtures/bots/stonkfun/).
 *  · Real StonkFun launches (initialize_with_token_2022, e.g. 4wACyqyi…R7AU, slot
 *    450,137,208) carry fifteen IDL accounts plus a sixteenth: the platform curve rule
 *    PDA(["platform_curve_rule", platform_config, global_config]), re-derived exactly.
 *
 *  · CashCat's OWN transactions were simulated on mainnet (simulateTransaction, sigVerify off,
 *    a funded third-party address as the payer and an unused mint address; nothing was signed
 *    or sent), each without error: pump.fun create_v2 (94,684 units, 0.0055497 SOL of rent and
 *    fees), pump.fun create_v2 quoted in SPYx through Custom Pairs (131,593 units, 0.00711 SOL),
 *    and StonkFun's initialize_with_token_2022 paired with SPYx (98,816 units, 0.0086739 SOL).
 *    The transactions and results are in fixtures/bots/pumpfun/ and fixtures/bots/stonkfun/.
 *  · The public mainnet endpoint answered getTokenLargestAccounts with 429 ("too many requests
 *    for a specific RPC call") all day, and a second public endpoint asked for a personal
 *    token; getProgramAccounts on the token program with a mint filter and a 40-byte slice
 *    answered, so that is how Popcat reads holders.
 *
 * ══ WHAT WAS READ OFF LIVE APIS ON 2026-09-24 ══════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 *  · StonkFun documents building a launch yourself on https://www.stonkfun.xyz/developers
 *    (read live): GET /api/public/v1/pairs?launchable=true&launchLabReady=true, then
 *    GET /api/public/v1/launchlab/pricing?quoteMint=… for configId, supply, totalSellA and the
 *    raw raise; initialize_with_token_2022 at 6 decimals, a constant curve migrating to
 *    cpmm, no transfer-fee extension for a standard launch, the standard platform id, and the
 *    curve-rule account appended last, read-only. /api/public/v1/stats answered
 *    launchLabEnabled: true, paidLaunchesEnabled: false.
 *  · pump.fun: frontend-api-v3.pump.fun/coins (sort=created_timestamp and
 *    sort=last_trade_timestamp, 200; about 27 new coins a minute that evening) and
 *    /coins-v2/user-created-coins/{creator} (200) answer without a key.
 *    On 2026-09-25 the newest-coins listing served offsets 0 to 1,000 and answered an empty
 *    list past that (1,050 coins, about forty minutes of launches that night), ignored a
 *    searchTerm, and /coins/search answered 404: Popcat's queue and its fifteen-minute
 *    schedule exist because of that depth (bots/popcat/callout.mjs).
 *    frontend-api-v3.pump.fun/metas/current answered 404, so pump.fun "metas" are NOT a
 *    trend source here. pump.fun's own metadata JSON shape ({ name, symbol, description,
 *    image, showName, createdOn: "https://pump.fun", twitter?, telegram?, website? }) and
 *    its metadata URI form (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<cid>) were read from pump.fun's live
 *    frontend code; its old upload endpoint pump.fun/api/ipfs is documented as no longer
 *    supported (PumpPortal's docs, read live), so metadata goes to Pinata (below).
 *  · Pinata: POST https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files answered 401 without a key (the
 *    endpoint is there); its documented form is multipart { file, network: "public",
 *    name } with Authorization: Bearer <JWT>, answering { data: { cid, … } }. A launch
 *    reads the metadata back through https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/<cid> (it served a
 *    real pump.fun metadata document that minute) before anything is built. pump.fun's own
 *    gateway, pump.mypinata.cloud, served some CIDs and answered 403 for others, so Popcat
 *    tries it first and Pinata's public gateway second.
 *  · Trend sources that answered: https://trends.google.com/trending/rss?geo=US (RSS 2.0,
 *    items with ht:approx_traffic and ht:news_item_title) and
 *    https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/search/trending ({ coins, nfts, categories }).
 *  · Jupiter: https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v2/tag?query=verified (3,692 tokens) and
 *    /tokens/v2/search?query=… (isVerified, tags) answered without a key.
