/**
 * THE SECOND BOOK — the sniper lane's own positions, and the invariant that keeps the
 * two lanes from ever touching each other's money.
 *
 * ── WHY A SECOND BOOK AND NOT A `lane` FIELD ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The cheap-looking option was one book with `pos.lane === "snipe"` on the sniper rows.
 * It was rejected on a measurement, not on taste. `poller.mjs:726` reads
 *
 *     const openList = () => Object.values(S.positions);
 *
 * and that one expression feeds `manageOpen`, `mirrorTick`, `recordPositionFailure`,
 * book heat, `positionEntryBlock` and `reconcileHeldCalls`. A lane field means auditing
 * every one of those call sites and every one written after today, and being right each
 * time; the day somebody adds a seventh consumer without reading this comment, a snipe
 * row is a desk row. A SECOND BOOK means `openList()` CANNOT SEE A SNIPE BY
 * CONSTRUCTION — the fence is the data structure, not a convention that has to be
 * remembered. Nothing in this file reads `S.positions` except the invariant, and the
 * invariant reads it only to prove the two books are disjoint.
 *
 * The same reasoning runs the other way: `stepPosition` is never called for a snipe and
 * `snipeStep` never for a desk position, because neither engine can reach the other's
 * book. The desk path stays byte-identical, which is an owner decision taken after a
 * measured incident (desk-led-v4), and this file imports nothing from trade-policy.mjs,
 * strategy.mjs or desk-mirror.mjs to keep it that way.
 *
 * ── RAW AMOUNTS ARE STORED AS DIGIT STRINGS, AND THAT IS MEASURED ────────────────────
 *
 * All the arithmetic on this lane is BigInt, because a standard pump.fun curve holds
 * ~1.07e15 base units and doubles stop counting by ones at 2^53. But the runtime state
 * this book lives in is JOURNALLED AS JSON: `journal.mjs:971` writes each position with
 * `json(value)` = `JSON.stringify`, and `JSON.stringify(1n)` THROWS
 * "Do not know how to serialize a BigInt". A BigInt in this book would therefore not
 * fail here, where it would be seen — it would fail at the next durable write, on the
 * money path, with a position already open. That is exactly why the desk's own rows
 * store `qtyRaw: String(...)` and `costBasisLamports: ...toString()`
 * (`poller.mjs:1084-1086`), and this book follows it: every raw amount goes in as a
 * BigInt, a digit string or a safe integer and comes back out as a DIGIT STRING —
 * the form `snipe-curve.mjs rawAmount()` already accepts unchanged. `test-snipe-book.mjs`
 * asserts the whole book survives a JSON round trip and that a BigInt left in it does not.
 *
 * ── WHAT "THE BOOK REFUSES A POSITION IT CANNOT PRICE" MEANS ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The sniper's ruler is a simulated sell:
 *
 *     markX = sellExactIn(curve, pos.qtyRaw) / pos.entryInputLamports
 *
 * so a row without a positive `qtyRaw` and a positive `entryInputLamports` HAS NO MARK.
 * Not a stale mark, not a wide mark — no mark at all, on a lane whose every downward
 * trigger (floor, armed stop, take) is a comparison against one. A position with no mark
 * cannot be exited by price and would sit in the book until the clock fired, which is a
 * silent hold, which is the failure `strategy.mjs:433-436` already produces for a
 * position that lands in the wrong book. The lane may not enter what it cannot exit, and
 * the book will not FILE what it cannot price.
 *
 * The same test runs on the fee economics. `frictionXFor()` from snipe-curve.mjs is the
 * single definition of round-trip friction in this repo; the book calls it at open, so a
 * row that cannot produce a finite breakeven multiple is refused at the moment it is
 * created rather than discovered by a determiner that has to decide something about it.
 * And a fill whose fee per leg is not strictly smaller than its ticket has NO breakeven
 * multiple at all — proceeds never reach outlay at any mark — so it is refused by name
 * instead of being stored with an Infinity nobody prints.
 *
 * ── THE ECONOMICS ARE FROZEN AT OPEN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `frictionX` is a fact about the lamports that were actually paid, so it must not drift
 * after the fill: `updateSnipe()` refuses any change to `sizeSol`, `feeSolPerLeg`,
 * `entry`, `openedAt`, `entryInputLamports`, `entryFeeLamports`, `creator`, `venue`,
 * `mint` or `lane`, and refuses a `qtyRaw` that has GROWN — a snipe never adds to a
 * position, it only sells part or all of one. The determiner's own working fields (the
 * confirmed high, the witness record, whatever it arms) are free to move; the fill is not.
 *
 * ── PURITY AND CLOCKS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `openSnipe`, `updateSnipe` and `closeSnipe` are the book's writers, so they mutate
 * `S.snipes` — that is their job — but they never mutate their argument, never call
 * `Date.now()` and never read the network. `openedAt` and `closedAt` ARRIVE AS
 * PARAMETERS, which is what makes a replay of a captured sample produce byte-identical
 * rows. `snipeList` and `assertLaneInvariant` are pure reads.
 *
 * NOTE ON THE NAME `openSnipe`. snipe-policy.mjs exports an opener of the same name and
 * they are different jobs, deliberately: the POLICY's opener authors the record the
 * determiner will step, and THIS one validates a record and FILES it. The book does not
 * import the policy — a book that imports the determiner is a cycle the moment the
 * determiner wants to read the book, and the book has to be the thing both lanes can be
 * checked against rather than a participant in either. Import them aliased.

 *     than against what `openSnipe` would have produced.
