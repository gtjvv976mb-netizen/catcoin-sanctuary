/**
 * GRADE THE TWO RULERS — the one experiment that could give this bot an entry edge.
 *
 * Measured over the owner's 64 traded launches: nothing observable at entry orders the
 * outcome. Buyers ahead of us, seconds late, trades on the curve — every Spearman ρ under
 * 0.13, which at n=64 is noise. The exits leak real money and fixing them still loses
 * (best modelled ladder: −0.122 SOL against an actual −0.361). So the loss is not an exit
 * problem and not a latency problem. It is that the bot cannot tell a good launch from a
 * bad one, and pays 2.5% a round trip to find out.
 *
 * `creator_profile` and `launch_share` are the two filters the rug literature actually
 * names. Both are implemented as gates in snipe-entry.mjs. Both are `undefined` by
 * default, so they measure and never kill — deliberately, because a number is not evidence
 * until it has been run against a case whose answer is already known.
 *
 * This is the command that runs them against known answers.
 *
 * WHAT IT GRADES, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE 64 TRADES
 *
 * The obvious dataset is the traded book: 64 launches with realised P&L. It is also the
 * wrong one, twice over. It is small, and it is SELECTED — those 64 are the launches that
 * cleared every other gate, so grading a ruler on them asks "does this separate winners
 * among coins we already agreed to buy", which is not the question.
 *
 * The shadow book answers the real one. It records a row for every launch the lane
 * EVALUATES — the refused ones included — and samples each row's forward path whether or
 * not we bought. At ~29 launches a minute that is thousands of graded rows a day, none of
 * them selected by the gates under test. `snipeScorecard()` then scores each ruler over
 * exactly the rows where the measurement exists AND the outcome is known.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CLASS IS A BAD LAUNCH, NOT A GOOD ONE
 *
 * `positiveOutcome` is "the curve's real quote reserve never advanced past the would-have-
 * fill within the forward window" — a launch nobody followed us into. These two rulers are
 * REFUSALS: a high precision means "when this ruler flags a launch, that launch really was
 * one nobody followed". That is what makes it safe to promote to a kill, and it is why the
 * bar is precision rather than accuracy: the cost of a false flag is a missed winner.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE PROMOTES ANYTHING. The scorecard reports; arming a proxy as a kill is a
 * separate registered change the owner makes deliberately.
