/**
 * THE t=0 GATE, AND THE ENTRY ENVELOPE THAT REPLACES A SLIPPAGE TOLERANCE.
 *
 * One ordered list of gates, cheapest first, first failure names the refusal — the shape
 * `entry-contract.mjs ENTRY_GATES` already established for the desk lane, because a
 * refusal that carries the same code on both sides of a fence is the only kind two
 * processes can argue about later. Everything here is pure: no I/O, no clock of its own,
 * no keypair, no mutation of an argument. The lane hands in the bytes it already read and
 * the clock it already has; this file only judges.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN, NOT THE DECORATION ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each gate carries a COST TIER, and the array is asserted (at import, and again in the
 * test) to be non-decreasing in cost:
 *
 *   0  in-process. No network at all — the lane switch, the sentinels, the book, the
 *      clock. A launch refused here costs nothing but the notice that produced it.
 *   1  the ONE getMultipleAccounts the lane makes anyway — curve account + mint account,
 *      both endpoints, one round trip. Nothing below tier 1 issues a second read.
 *   2  pure arithmetic on bytes already fetched. Free once tier 1 has paid.
 *   3  the statistical layer, which may need one or two extra reads and is DELIBERATELY
 *      LAST and deliberately not a kill by default (see `creator_profile` below).
 *   4  pre-signature, no network: the fee budget and our own instruction bytes decoded
 *      back.
 *
 * At a launch the whole budget is the slot. Ordering by cost is not tidiness, it is the
 * difference between refusing a hostile mint for free and refusing it after paying for
 * two reads we were never going to use.
 *
 * ── THE MINT KILL SET IS REUSED, NOT REINVENTED ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The desk already derives exactly the facts this gate needs, for free, from the mint
 * account it reads anyway: `src/data/solana.js mintInfo()` reports `mint_authority_live`,
 * `freeze_authority_live` and one `ext_<name>` flag per extension outside
 * `BOT_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`, and names transferHook / permanentDelegate /
 * defaultAccountState explicitly. This file does not re-decide any of that. It consumes
 * either shape — the raw account (through the executor's own `auditMintAccount`) or the
 * jsonParsed record `mintInfo()` returns — and refuses under ONE code, `mint_refused`,
 * carrying the desk's own flag names in its detail.
 *
 * The allowlist is DERIVED from `token2022.mjs ALLOWED_MINT_EXTENSIONS` rather than typed
 * out again, because the executor's copy is the one that throws on the money path and
 * `src/data/solana.js:36-40` records why the desk's is a mirror rather than an import
 * (@solana/web3.js is an executor dependency; importing across that boundary breaks the
 * desk's boot). test-snipe-entry.mjs reads src/data/solana.js AS TEXT and asserts the set
 * derived here is character-for-character the same set, so a drift is a red test.
 *
 * MEASURED, THIS PASS, AGAINST MAINNET (free getAccountInfo, three real pump.fun mints —
 * the ruler validated against cases whose answer was not known in advance and then was):
 *
 *   9BB6NFEc…pump   owner Tokenkeg… (classic)  mintAuthority null  freezeAuthority null  decimals 6  ext []
 *   FgJReZeY…pump   owner Tokenz…   (2022)     mintAuthority null  freezeAuthority null  decimals 6  ext [metadataPointer, tokenMetadata]
 *   HRkkxgaF…pump   owner Tokenz…   (2022)     mintAuthority null  freezeAuthority null  decimals 6  ext [metadataPointer, tokenMetadata]
 *
 * Both extensions are inside the allowlist, and both authorities are already renounced.
 * That matters because a kill set that refuses the entire population is indistinguishable
 * from a kill set that works until you count — which is the whole reason the hit-rate
 * assertion at the bottom of the test exists. What is NOT verified: whether a mint looks
 * like this AT t=0, one slot after the create, rather than at the moment it was read
 * here. Only the observe log answers that, and it is listed as such.
 *
 * ── THE CEILING IS NOT A SLIPPAGE TOLERANCE ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `planSnipeCeiling()` reads no slippage term and there is no argument by which one can
 * be introduced (`tolerance` exists only so a caller that passes one gets an exception
 * instead of a fill). A tolerance says "fill me up to x% worse than I asked"; against a
 * launch curve that is a standing offer to whoever lands in front of us, because anything
 * that moves the reserve between our decode and our slot moves it in exactly that
 * direction. The ceiling says instead: this many lamports at the state we read, and if
 * the state moved, REVERT. A reverted race costs one network fee — already charged to
 * BOTH daily counters through `journal.mjs attempt_fee_events` (:302-309, rolled in at
 * :544-550), so a landed-and-reverted race consumes `dailySolCap` and counts against
 * `dailyLossLimitSol` without anything new being built — and it buys nothing at a worse
 * price. That is the correct trade at this size.
 *
 * `jupiterEquivalentWorstCost()` exists ONLY so the test can prove that claim as an
 * inequality rather than assert it as a belief: for the same curve and the same spend,
 * our ceiling is never looser than what Jupiter's own envelope would have permitted at
 * `LIVE_LIMITS.slippageBps` (300). It is not called on any live path and must not be.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE REFUSES TO DO ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It encodes no instruction, names no discriminator and orders no accounts. NO VENUE
 * INSTRUCTION LAYOUT IS VERIFIED ANYWHERE IN THIS REPO. `assertSnipeInstruction()`
 * therefore REFUSES — every time, in both lanes — until the adapter it is handed carries
 * a layout proof that `snipe-venue.mjs` accepts: `layoutVerified === true` plus a
 * `layoutProof` naming mainnet, the adapter's own program, and a real decode round trip
 * per proved method. An unverified venue is an entry refusal, not a best guess, and the
 * refusal arrives at gate `instruction_mismatch` with the venue clause in its detail.
 *
 * ── GATE CLASS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `src/calls.js gateClass()` answers SAFETY for any code it has not heard of (:579), and
 * the 33 SAFETY gates in that table are FROZEN. Every code here is therefore SAFETY by
 * default-deny, which is the correct direction and costs nothing today because no desk
 * file emits one. The test asserts the codes are DISJOINT from the existing table — if a
 * snipe code ever collided with a desk code it would silently re-point a desk refusal —
 * and re-pins the measured 33/21 split so a sniper change that edits that table is loud.

   * A COIN THIS LANE CANNOT PAY FOR.
   *
   * pump.fun curves may be quoted in a mint other than SOL — measured on mainnet
   * 2026-09-17, with live launches quoted in USDC and in ORE arriving in the feed minutes
   * apart. This lane is denominated in SOL from end to end: the ticket is
   * `maxSolPerTrade`, the brake is `dailySolCap`, the balance gate reads lamports, and the
   * journal books the result in lamports. It has no path that spends USDC and the burner
   * holds none.
   *
   * Before this gate the refusal happened on chain instead, and badly: the decoder
   * reported every curve as SOL-quoted, so the buy named WSOL as `quote_mint`, derived
   * every quote account from WSOL, and the program answered MintDoesNotMatchBondingCurve
   * (6004) — an opaque failure on a coin that was never buyable. Refused here, by name,
   * before an instruction exists.
   *
   * Supporting a non-SOL quote is not a matter of passing a different mint: it needs the
   * quote token's own program, its decimals, a balance of it in the wallet, and a sizing
   * and risk vocabulary that is not lamports. THE ALLOWLIST IS WHERE THAT IS SUPPLIED.
   * A curve quoted in a mint on `cfg.quoteMintAllowlist` passes here when — and only
   * when — the caller handed the contract that mint's facts (`args.quote`: `describeMint`
   * of the quote mint plus the wallet's ticket, cap and day ledger in its raw units) and
   * those facts survived `quoteTicketFor`. Then the ticket above is already denominated
   * in the quote, and every gate below judges in it. The xStocks (GLDx, TSLAx, SPYx,
   * measured 2026-09-24 in fixtures/pumpfun-xstock-quote.json) are Token-2022 mints with
   * a permanent delegate, a live freeze authority and a Pausable extension: the kill set
   * this lane applies to the BASE mint would refuse every one of them, and rightly so —
   * the buyer never holds the quote long enough for those to matter. What does matter is
   * `paused`: a paused mint moves nothing, so a paused quote is a refusal by name.
   *
   * With an EMPTY allowlist — the executor's default, and the browser lane's until the
   * user lists a mint — this gate refuses exactly as it did before the allowlist existed.
