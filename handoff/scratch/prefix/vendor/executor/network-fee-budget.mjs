/**
 * THE NETWORK-FEE CEILING, LIFTED OUT SO TWO LANES SHARE ONE DEFINITION.
 *
 * This is `validateOrderEnvelope`'s fee block moved verbatim out of jupiter.mjs and
 * nothing else. It is a LIFT, not a rewrite: same constants, same comparisons, same
 * message text, same fail-open and fail-closed corners. The desk path is expected to
 * keep behaving byte-for-byte as it did, and `test-network-fee-budget.mjs` proves that
 * by running the same inputs through `validateOrderEnvelope` and through this function
 * and asserting the two agree on both the verdict and the message string.
 *
 * The original, `executor/jupiter.mjs:172-186` as read on 2026-09-11:
 *
 *     const signatureFee = finite(order.signatureFeeLamports ?? 0, "signature fee");
 *     const priorityFee = finite(order.prioritizationFeeLamports ?? 0, "priority fee");
 *     const rentFee = finite(order.rentFeeLamports ?? 0, "rent fee");
 *     if ([signatureFee, priorityFee, rentFee].some((value) => value < 0))
 *       throw new Error("Jupiter returned a negative fee estimate");
 *     const networkFees = signatureFee + priorityFee;
 *     if (networkFees > cfg.maxNetworkFeeLamports)
 *       throw new Error(`non-rent network fees ${networkFees} lamports exceed cap ${cfg.maxNetworkFeeLamports}`);
 *     const feeBasis = BigInt(String(expected.feeBasisLamports ?? expected.amountRaw));
 *     const maxNetworkFeePct = Number(cfg.maxNetworkFeePct ?? 10);
 *     if (feeBasis <= 0n || !Number.isFinite(maxNetworkFeePct) || maxNetworkFeePct < 0 ||
 *         BigInt(Math.ceil(networkFees)) * 10_000n > feeBasis * BigInt(Math.floor(maxNetworkFeePct * 100)))
 *       throw new Error(`estimated network fees exceed ${maxNetworkFeePct}% of the trade basis`);
 *     if (rentFee > (cfg.maxRentLamports ?? MAX_GROSS_RENT_LAMPORTS))
 *       throw new Error(`rent ${rentFee} lamports exceeds cap ${cfg.maxRentLamports ?? MAX_GROSS_RENT_LAMPORTS}`);
 *
 * WHY LIFT IT AT ALL. The sniper lane has to answer the same question before it signs
 * (gates 18 `network_fee_over_cap` and 19 `rent_over_cap`) and it does not go through
 * Jupiter to get there — it builds its own venue instruction, so it never constructs a
 * Jupiter order envelope for `validateOrderEnvelope` to inspect. The alternative to a
 * lift is a second implementation of a live money gate, which is how two copies of one
 * ceiling drift apart; this repo already carries a test whose whole subject is four
 * copies of a cap that did exactly that (test-operator-max-parity.mjs). One definition,
 * two callers, and a differential test pinning them.
 *
 * WHAT THE 172-176 LINES ARE DOING HERE. The block at :177-186 is not standalone: it
 * consumes three already-normalised numbers. Rather than take the caller's word for
 * that, the normalisation comes with it, so this function is safe to hand raw envelope
 * fields. Called from `validateOrderEnvelope` after its own :172-176 the three checks
 * are exact no-ops — `finite()` of a finite number is that number, and a value already
 * proved non-negative stays non-negative — so the lift is still behaviour-neutral.
 *
 * TWO LIFTED QUIRKS, PRESERVED ON PURPOSE AND NAMED SO NOBODY RELIES ON THEM:
 *
 *   1. `networkFees > cfg.maxNetworkFeeLamports` is FALSE when the cap is undefined,
 *      because every comparison with undefined is false. A cfg with no
 *      `maxNetworkFeeLamports` therefore has no absolute lamport ceiling at all. That
 *      is the behaviour on the desk path today and changing it here would be a silent
 *      change to a live gate, so it stays. The percentage ceiling below still binds
 *      (it defaults to 10), which is why this has never been load-bearing. Any new
 *      caller — the sniper included — must pass a cfg with the cap set; the test
 *      asserts the quirk rather than pretending it is absent.
 *   2. A missing basis throws `Cannot convert undefined to a BigInt`, a SyntaxError
 *      from `BigInt("undefined")`, not a sentence of ours. Also lifted as-is: it fails
 *      closed, which is the direction that matters, and inventing a nicer message here
 *      would make this function and `validateOrderEnvelope` disagree.
 *
 * ARITHMETIC. The percentage test is exact integer arithmetic in BigInt on both sides —
 * `ceil(fees) * 10_000 > basis * floor(pct * 100)` — so it carries no float error at any
 * basis size. `pctOfBasis` in the returned record is a float and is REPORT ONLY: print
 * it, log it, put it in a shadow row, never re-derive a decision from it.
 *
 * MEASURED, AT THE LIVE SIZE (poller.mjs LIVE_LIMITS, read this pass): basis
 * 0.005 SOL = 5,000,000 lamports, `maxNetworkFeePct` 10, `maxNetworkFeeLamports`
 * 2,000,000. The percentage ceiling is 500,000 lamports — a quarter of the absolute
 * one — so at live size THE PERCENTAGE GATE BINDS and the lamport cap is slack. The
 * test derives both from poller.mjs source rather than restating them, and prints them.

 * when a cfg carries no `maxRentLamports`. This is the same 4,200,000 that jupiter.mjs
 * exports under this name and that poller.mjs LIVE_LIMITS imports from there; the test
 * reads jupiter.mjs as text and fails loudly if the two literals ever diverge. When the
