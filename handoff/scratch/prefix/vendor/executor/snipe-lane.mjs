/**
 * THE SNIPER LANE — feed -> gate -> ceiling -> shadow -> determiner, AND NOTHING ELSE.
 *
 * OBSERVE-ONLY, and structurally rather than by policy. No keypair is loaded on any path
 * in this file, nothing is signed, nothing is sent, and the venue adapter this lane hands
 * to the gate stack is a FACADE whose three instruction encoders throw
 * (`observeOnlyVenue()` below). A lane that merely declined to call `buyIx` would be one
 * careless edit from calling it; a lane that cannot reach it is a different kind of
 * object. `test-snipe-lane.mjs` drives the whole pipeline and then asserts the real
 * adapter's encoder counters are still zero.
 *
 * IT IS NOT STARTED AT IMPORT. Importing this module opens no socket, starts no timer,
 * reads no environment and creates no Connection — `createSnipeLane()` builds an object,
 * and only `start()` subscribes. Nothing in poller.mjs calls any of it yet. That is
 * deliberate: the five narrow poller/journal edits are a separate commit, and until they
 * land this lane cannot trade because nothing invokes it.
 *
 * ── WHY THE CONFIG IS A SEPARATE OBJECT AND NOT A BRANCH OF CFG ─────────────────────
 *
 * `snipeLaneConfig()` reads ONLY `SNIPE_*` environment names into its own frozen object.
 * A shared config builder is the one realistic way a sniper dial silently re-enables a
 * bot-led exit on the desk path: the desk holds unconditionally (strategy.mjs
 * stepPosition returns hold without a deskExit) because the owner decided that after a
 * measured incident, and a key with the same name in both objects is how that decision
 * gets edited by someone who thought they were tuning a sniper. Two objects, two prefixes,
 * one test that asserts the names are disjoint.
 *
 * ── THE TWO FEE NUMBERS ARE NOT THE SAME NUMBER, AND CONFLATING THEM BREAKS THE BOOK ─
 *
 * poller.mjs:199-204 splits them on purpose and this lane inherits the split verbatim:
 *
 *   · `expectedNetworkFeeLamports` (500,000) is a COST MODEL. It sizes the position —
 *     `networkFeeReserveSol` feeds `minViableSolPerTrade`, therefore `snipeFloor`,
 *     therefore the derived 0.80 stop distance, and it is the fee inside `frictionX`.
 *     Raising it can only ever REFUSE trades.
 *   · What `assertNetworkFeeBudget` judges is the ESTIMATED signature + priority fee of
 *     the actual transaction. Measured on four live rehearsals on 2026-09-03 those ran
 *     1,356 to 92,207 lamports on a ~135k CU transaction (poller.mjs:159-177), i.e. one
 *     to two orders of magnitude under the cost model.
 *
 * Feeding the cost model into the budget gate refuses everything at the live cap: the
 * basis is the entry ceiling (<= 5,000,000 lamports) and `maxNetworkFeePct 10` admits at
 * most 500,000, so a 500,000-lamport "fee" is ON the boundary and one lamport of rounding
 * in the ceiling puts it over. A shadow book that refuses every row at gate 19 measures
 * its own arithmetic instead of the market. So the observe fee model here is the MEASURED
 * PEAK priority fee plus the chain's fixed per-signature 5,000 — the conservative end of
 * the real distribution — while the cost model keeps its own name and its own job.
 *
 * ── THE SECOND ENDPOINT IS NOT OPTIONAL ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * poller.mjs:660-663 opens a secondary Connection only when EXECUTE is on, so in the
 * observe configuration the poller has ONE endpoint — and the whole witness design (§2.3:
 * two witnesses, strictly increasing slots, DIFFERENT endpoints) could not run. An observe
 * book that validates a rule the live lane does not run is worse than no book, so this
 * lane requires two readers with distinct ids UNCONDITIONALLY and refuses to start with
 * one. It also never constructs a Connection itself: readers are injected, which is what
 * makes the whole pipeline runnable offline against fakes.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE DAILY CAP MEANS WHEN NOTHING IS SPENT ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `daily_capacity` is a real gate and it runs on every notice. But in observe the ticket
 * is hypothetical, and charging hypothetical tickets against the real 0.01 SOL cap would
 * silence the book after TWO notices a day — the book would then be a measurement of our
 * own cap rather than of the market, and the 200-row sample floor would take a hundred
 * days to reach. So `chargeDailyCap` defaults to false in observe: the gate is evaluated
 * against whatever `deployedTodaySol` the caller actually supplies (the journal's real
 * number, which already includes reverted-race fees — F3), and the would-have-entries are
 * counted in the report instead. Set `SNIPE_CHARGE_DAILY_CAP=1` and the lane charges them
 * and goes quiet exactly as the live lane would; the test drives both directions and
 * prints the row counts each produced.
 *
 * ── THE DETERMINER IS BOUND, NOT IMPORTED BY NAME ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `snipe-policy.mjs` on disk is a DRAFT (spec §7.1: it was written by a parallel session
 * and §2.4 says its `stopFrac: 0.70` must be replaced by the derivation, because at the
 * live cap `minViableSolPerTrade(cfg, 0.70) = 0.005714` is a position the repo's own
 * sizing engine refuses). The spec's rewrite exports `openSnipe`/`snipeStep`; the draft
 * exports `freshSnipe`/`snipePolicy`. This lane binds through `bindDeterminer()`, which
 * accepts EITHER shape and refuses loudly when neither is present — so whichever draft
 * survives the owner's decision, the lane is wired to it without this file being the
 * thing that has to change, and without it silently running against half an API.
