/**
 * THE SNIPER'S OWN EXIT DETERMINER.
 *
 * The desk-led executor holds unconditionally: strategy.mjs stepPosition() returns
 * `{action:"hold"}` unless the DESK supplies a deskExit, and the shared pricePolicy is
 * reached only through that branch or desk-mirror.mjs. That is a deliberate owner
 * decision taken after a measured incident, and nothing here touches it.
 *
 * But a sniper has no desk. There is no time to think in a launch — the paid seats cost
 * ~$1.12 and many seconds — so the lane is deterministic and free, and it must therefore
 * carry its own exit. This module is that exit, kept in a SEPARATE FILE from
 * trade-policy.mjs on purpose: the desk path must remain byte-identical, and a shared
 * file is how a "small change for the sniper" becomes a change to how the desk exits.
 *
 * ── THE ASYMMETRY THAT RUNS THROUGH ALL OF IT ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * BE SLOW TO ARM, FAST TO EXIT.
 *
 * Arming breakeven or a trail is IRREVERSIBLE — the stops it sets can never come back
 * down — so it must never happen on a mark that was not real. Selling is not: the desk's
 * own note makes the point exactly right, that a sell executes at a REAL re-quoted price,
 * so acting on a bad mark costs a premature exit at the true market, never a manufactured
 * loss. Therefore every ARM here reads a CONFIRMED mark and every SELL reads the RAW one.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT THE DESK'S TWO-WITNESS RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * trade-policy.mjs commits a new high only when the mark clears the old high on TWO
 * CONSECUTIVE ticks, taking the lower of the two. It exists for a real, measured reason:
 * a one-block WSOL-heavy pool read a sell quote rich at 1.9x, armed breakeven and the
 * trail on a position whose true price was 1.1x, and the next honest tick force-sold it
 * as a ratcheted stop. That rule is correct where it lives, and its own justification
 * says so: "the trail is 25%, a 15s tick costs it nothing."
 *
 * It is the wrong ruler HERE, and the reason is worth stating precisely rather than
 * retuning it by feel. The rule conflates two different things:
 *
 *     (a) confirming that a mark is REAL, and
 *     (b) waiting a fixed number of CONSECUTIVE ticks.
 *
 * Only (a) is the safety property. (b) is an implementation of it that happens to be
 * free when a tick is 15 seconds and a hold is hours.
 *
 * BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY BREAKS, because the sloppy version of this argument
 * would justify arming on one print. A genuinely single-observation run arms under
 * NEITHER rule, and it should not: one print is not confirmation, and that is the whole
 * incident. What breaks is INTERLEAVED prints. A launch quotes irregularly across two
 * pools, so a real run reads 5.0, 1.0, 5.0 far more often than it reads 5.0, 5.0 — and
 * "two CONSECUTIVE clearing ticks" rejects the first sequence while accepting the second,
 * though both contain two independent observations of the same high. The rule that
 * protects the desk from a glitch therefore drops real runs in this lane while leaving
 * every loser intact. That is not conservatism; it is a biased ruler.
 *
 * SO CONFIRMATION HERE IS A ROLLING MEDIAN, NOT A RUN OF CONSECUTIVE TICKS. The high-water
 * candidate is the median of the last `confirmWindow` observations (default 3). It keeps
 * the safety property exactly — a lone spike between ordinary ticks cannot move a median,
 * so it commits nothing, which is the incident the desk's rule was written for — while
 * dropping the requirement that the clearing ticks be consecutive. It also has three
 * properties the consecutive rule does not:
 *
 *   - it accepts two independent observations whether or not they are adjacent, which is
 *     the actual failure above, while still rejecting any lone outlier;
 *   - it is tick-rate agnostic: it behaves the same at 200ms and at 15s;
 *   - it degrades honestly on a short history (fewer than `confirmWindow` marks confirms
 *     nothing, so a position that has just opened cannot arm on its first print);
 *   - it needs no notion of "consecutive", which is meaningless when marks arrive from a
 *     stream at irregular intervals.
 *
 * The desk's recorded incident is a test case here, not a footnote: t1 glitch 1.9 then t2
 * real 1.1 must arm nothing. test-snipe-policy.mjs drives exactly that sequence.
 *
 * ── AND THE TRIGGER THE DESK DOES NOT HAVE ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A launch has one signal no later market does: THE CREATOR SELLING. Nothing else on a
 * one-minute-old coin is as informative, and it is observable — the deployer's wallet is
 * known at t=0. `creatorSold` is a first-class trigger here and it outranks everything
 * except the hard stop.
 *
 * PURE. No I/O, no provider, no clock of its own, no mutation of its argument. Everything
 * it needs arrives as arguments, which is what makes the whole thing testable against
 * sequences whose right answer is known in advance.

/**
 * THE ROUND TRIP IS THE DOMINANT TERM AT LIVE SIZE, AND IT REWRITES TWO DEFAULTS.
 *
 * Measured against the repo's own frozen rails, not chosen:
 *   LIVE_LIMITS.maxSolPerTrade        = 0.005   SOL   (poller.mjs:155)
 *   expectedNetworkFeeLamports        = 500_000       (poller.mjs:199) = 0.0005 SOL
 *
 * So a live position pays 0.0005 SOL to get in and again to get out: 0.001 SOL of
 * friction on a 0.005 SOL position. TWENTY PERCENT, round trip.
 *
 * TWO CONSEQUENCES, both of which broke the first version of this file:
 *
 * 1. THE STOP CANNOT BE TIGHT, BECAUSE A TIGHT ONE CANNOT BE FUNDED.
 *    strategy.mjs minViableSolPerTrade() caps fees at maxFeeShareOfStop (0.25) of the
 *    STOP DISTANCE, so a tighter stop demands a LARGER position to stay inside that
 *    share. Bisected against the real function: the tightest stop distance a 0.005 SOL
 *    position can carry is 0.80 — a stop at 0.20x entry. A stop at 0.70x entry needs
 *    0.0133 SOL, which is 2.7x the live cap, so it is not fundable at all.
 *    THEREFORE THE PRICE STOP HERE IS A CATASTROPHE BACKSTOP, NOT A RISK CONTROL. The
 *    real controls on this lane are the clock, the structural tripwires (creator sold,
 *    hostile chain fact, collapsed sell side) and the size. Do not "tighten the stop"
 *    to feel safer; it makes the position unfundable, which is not the same as safe.
 *
 * 2. "BREAKEVEN" IS NOT 1.0x. Selling at entry realises (s-f)/(s+f) - 1 = -18.18% at
 *    live size. The true breakeven multiple is (size + fee) / (size - fee) = 1.2222x,
 *    and it MOVES with fill size and observed fee, so it is computed per position by
 *    frictionX() rather than stored as a constant. The first version of this file armed
 *    a stop at entry and called it breakeven; it would have realised an 18% loss on
 *    every position it "protected".

   *
   * HAWK-AI's first 58 closed round trips, read back off mainnet on 2026-09-17 — the
   * whole record, 290 of 290 transactions fetched, nothing sampled:
   *
   *     hold time      n    won     net SOL    average
   *       0– 30s      32    25%     -0.8829     -2.3%
   *      30– 60s       3     0%     -0.1323    -12.4%
   *      60–120s       2   100%     +0.3436    +42.9%
   *     120–300s       3     0%     -0.2782    -23.6%
   *     600s+         18     0%     -0.6294    -10.2%
   *
   * EIGHTEEN POSITIONS REACHED THE TEN-MINUTE TIME STOP AND NOT ONE OF THEM WON. That is
   * not a thin edge, it is a clean sweep — and the worst of them decayed from roughly the
   * round-trip cost to −30% while the clock ran. Meanwhile every large winner this bot
   * has ever had resolved fast: +191% at 4s, +148% at 7s, +140% at 18s, +84% at 86s.
   *
   * So the rule the record supports is: A LAUNCH THAT HAS NOT MOVED IN YOUR FAVOUR
   * QUICKLY IS NOT GOING TO. `stallMs` is how long a position gets to get above
   * `stallAtX` × entry; failing that it leaves — not because a stop was hit, but because
   * the thesis of a launch entry is that it moves NOW, and a flat position at ninety
   * seconds has falsified that thesis while it is still cheap to say so.
   *
   * It sits ABOVE the time stop deliberately. The time stop is the backstop for a
   * position that is alive and merely drifting; this is the one for a position that never
   * got going. Both are now measured in minutes rather than ten of them.
   *
   * WHAT THIS IS NOT: a claim to have found the optimum. It is 58 trades from one bot
   * over one day — enough to say "18 for 18 is not noise", not enough to tune a constant
   * to the minute. The dials exist so the next 58 can move it.
   *
   * THE FIRST SIX TRADES UNDER IT, read back the same way later the same day (304 of 304
   * signatures, nothing sampled): the 600s+ bucket is EMPTY. Nothing reaches the clock
   * any more, which is this rule doing its job. Nothing else moved — 17% win before, 17%
   * after, one in six — and the average loser went from -21.5% to -16.7%, which is this
   * rule cutting losers sooner on a sample of five. Loss per trade more than halved, but
   * the clip also went 0.35 -> 0.1 SOL, so that is arithmetic and not edge. All four
   * post-change losers sat in the 120-300s band at -19%: cut earlier, still picked
   * wrong. Entry selection is where 48 losers in 58 came from, and nothing here touches
   * it. */

   * First, strategy.mjs DEFAULTS already owns a key called takeProfitX, and

   * as the same setting. So the name is different in kind, not in punctuation.
   *
   * Second, it states its own BASIS. The mark this lane works in is a round-trip
   * multiple: markX 1.0 already means "the sell returns what the buy paid at the venue".
   * "2x" against ENTRY is therefore what an owner means by doubling their money, but it
   * is NOT the realized return, because both legs of NETWORK fee sit outside the mark.
   * Realized = takeAtEntryX / frictionX - 1. At a 0.4 SOL ticket that is +99.5%; at the
