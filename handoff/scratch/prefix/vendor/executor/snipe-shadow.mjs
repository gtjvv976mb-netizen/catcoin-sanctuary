/**
 * THE SNIPER'S SHADOW BOOK — one row per notice, and a scorecard that promotes nothing.
 *
 * This is the primary deliverable of the sniper lane, not a stepping stone to it, and the
 * arithmetic says why: `dailySolCap 0.01 / maxSolPerTrade 0.005 = 2`, so a LIVE sniper
 * accrues evidence at two entries a day, maximum (poller.mjs:155-157). Two hundred rows
 * of live evidence is a hundred trading days. Two hundred rows of shadow evidence is a
 * quiet afternoon. Everything that can be learned without signing is learned here.
 *
 * ── WHAT A SHADOW BOOK CANNOT MEASURE, SAID FIRST BECAUSE IT IS THE POINT ────────────
 *
 * A SHADOW BOOK MARKS A FILL IT NEVER HAD TO WIN. That single sentence is the whole
 * limitation and it is not a rounding error on the result — it is a bias whose sign is
 * known in advance and whose magnitude is not.
 *
 * When this lane records "we would have bought at the ceiling", nobody had to lose that
 * race to us. On chain, the launches we would ACTUALLY have been filled on are the subset
 * that faster machines looked at and declined, plus the subset nobody else wanted. Those
 * two subsets are not a random sample of the rows in this book, and they are worse than
 * the rows in this book. So any "hit rate" computed here is a hit rate on a population
 * that would never have been ours, and any "P&L" is the P&L of an imaginary account that
 * won every race for free.
 *
 * THEREFORE THIS MODULE REFUSES TO PRINT EITHER. Not "labels them approximate" — refuses.
 * `assertReportHonest()` throws if a hit rate, a win rate, a P&L, an ROI or an expectancy
 * ever appears as a NUMBER anywhere in a report this file produces, and the renderer
 * prints those names only on a line that has no digits on it at all. A number that would
 * be read as a result has to be impossible to add by accident, because the pressure to
 * add it arrives exactly when the sample looks good.
 *
 * What it CAN measure, and does:
 *
 *   · SELECTION      — which gate refuses what, over the whole ordered trace, with the
 *                      first refusal named. That is a fact about our own rules.
 *   · PATH LATENCY   — hop-decomposed, notice -> would-have-signed, from real notices.
 *   · DETERMINER     — what the exit determiner did, replayably, on real bytes.
 *   · QUEUE DEPTH    — THE SLOT DELTA between the create and our first readable mark.
 *
 * The last one is the honest proxy for the thing the book cannot measure. It does not
 * tell us what we would have been filled at; it tells us HOW FAR BACK IN THE QUEUE THIS
 * MACHINE SITS, in the only unit the chain agrees on. A lane that is consistently eight
 * slots behind the create is a lane whose shadow fills were won by somebody else four
 * seconds earlier, and that is visible in this number long before it is visible in a
 * ledger. It is printed for EVERY entry, never averaged away into one summary figure —
 * the distribution is the finding, and a mean would hide the tail that matters.
 *
 * ── THE SCORECARD, AND WHY IT IS src/launch-shadow.js ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The desk already answered this exact question once, for the three rug proxies, and the
 * answer is `src/launch-shadow.js`: `PROXIES` (each `{rule, measured, flags}`),
 * `positiveVerdict`, and `proxyScorecard` computing tp/fp/fn/tn over the rows where the
 * proxy was ACTUALLY measured and the answer ACTUALLY known, with a `promotable` flag
 * gated on three numbers stated in advance. Those numbers are REUSED here rather than
 * invented — `PROMOTION_PRECISION_BAR 0.8`, `PROMOTION_MIN_ROWS 200`,
 * `PROMOTION_MIN_FLAGGED 10` (src/launch-shadow.js:112-114) — and its comment about them
 * applies here word for word: none has been tuned on data, there is no data yet, that is
 * what the log is for. Inventing a friendlier floor for a new lane is how a bar stops
 * being a bar.
 *
 * They are RE-DECLARED rather than imported, and the reason is mechanical rather than
 * stylistic: `src/launch-shadow.js` opens a SQLite handle at import (`import db from
 * "./lib/store.js"` and a top-level `db.exec`), and the executor is a separate process
 * with a separate dependency set — importing it here would open the desk's database from
 * the bot. `test-snipe-lane.mjs` reads that file AS TEXT and asserts the three numbers
 * still agree, which is the same mirror technique `test-token2022-mirror.mjs` uses to
 * hold `BOT_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` in step with the executor's own copy.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CLASS IS DEFINED BEFORE ANY ROW IS COLLECTED, which is the only way a
 * precision number means anything: a launch is POSITIVE (the thing a t=0 proxy ought to
 * flag) when the curve's REAL quote reserve never advanced past where it stood at the
 * would-have-fill, anywhere in the forward window. That is "a launch nobody followed" —
 * observable from the same bytes the lane already decodes, on every row, with no paid
 * read and no opinion in it.
 *
 * AND THE SCORECARD PROMOTES NOTHING. As in launch-shadow.js, `promotable` is a report to
 * the owner. Wiring a proxy as a kill is a separate registered change to `GATE_CLASS` —
 * `src/calls.js gateClass()` answers SAFETY for any code it has not heard of, so an
 * unregistered sniper gate silently becomes an un-waivable rug check.
 *
 * PURE, and impure in exactly one place. Every function here is a function of its
 * arguments: no clock, no fs, no network, no randomness, no mutation of an argument.
 * `createSnipeShadow()` holds rows in memory and hands each finished row to an INJECTED
 * `sink` if the caller supplied one; this file never opens a file or a database, so a
 * replay run and an observe run go through identical code.
