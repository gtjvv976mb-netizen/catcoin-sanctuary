/**
 * PUMP.FUN — the first venue adapter, and the first thing in this repo that reads a
 * program's own account bytes.
 *
 * It decodes. It quotes. IT SIGNS NOTHING, and the three methods that would emit program
 * bytes — buyIx, sellIx, decodeBuyIx — REFUSE by construction. That is not a stub waiting
 * to be filled in and it is not a configuration someone forgot to turn on: it is the
 * honest state of this repository, and snipe-venue.mjs's `layout_unverified` clause turns
 * it into an execute refusal that nobody has to remember to apply.
 *
 * ══ WHAT WAS MEASURED FOR THIS FILE, AND HOW IT WAS CHECKED ═══════════════════════════
 *
 * Every layout below was read off MAINNET on 2026-09-11 through the free public endpoint
 * https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com and cross-checked against an answer known BEFORE
 * the read. Nothing here is copied from memory and nothing is a plausible guess. The
 * accounts and transactions are named in PUMPFUN_LAYOUT_EVIDENCE so a reviewer can re-run
 * every one of them.
 *
 *  1. THE BONDING CURVE ACCOUNT — proved against pump.fun's own feed row.
 *     Account CaLhPyhttKFHy2T6i12HCuqocFCCKuf49Z5QYpS3Fp77 (124 bytes, owner
 *     6EF8rre…F6P) for mint BjPvXGPq6aPvamzeJAhRF5HaTixY4zAtRti1WtSepump. Decoded at the
 *     offsets below it reads vTok 1,069,079,517,066,588 / vSol 30,110,014,725 / rTok
 *     789,179,517,066,588 / rSol 110,014,725 / supply 1e15 / complete false / creator
 *     4Uko6H1FMJVuxxDjtnkjvbTf3adLmny5tWdnwdgLXLkt — every single field equal to the row
 *     frontend-api-v3.pump.fun returned for that mint in the same minute. Six independent
 *     agreements is not a coincidence of offsets.
 *
 *  2. THE ACCOUNT DISCRIMINATOR IS DERIVED, NOT PASTED. sha256("account:BondingCurve")
 *     truncated to 8 bytes is 17b7f83760d8ac60, and that is byte-for-byte the first eight
 *     bytes of both real accounts read. The anchor convention is therefore validated here
 *     rather than assumed — which matters, because §6 below is a case where it fails.
 *
 *  3. THERE ARE TWO REAL ACCOUNT LENGTHS AND THE SHORT ONE HAS NO CREATOR.
 *     Account Cg14LaBKV4TrN253WmpA55LB9R9ec38HMcgPjyiFaM5i, for a GRADUATED coin, is
 *     49 bytes: discriminator, five u64s, `complete = 1`, and then nothing. So `creator`
 *     is read only when the account is long enough to hold one, and a 49-byte curve
 *     reports `creator: null` instead of reading 32 bytes past the end of the buffer.
 *
 *  4. A GRADUATED CURVE READS ALL ZEROS, AND THAT IS WHY `complete` IS CHECKED FIRST.
 *     That same 49-byte account carries vTok 0 / vSol 0 / rTok 0 / rSol 0 while pump.fun's
 *     feed still reports its pre-graduation reserves (vSol 115,005,360,585). A mark
 *     computed from those bytes is 0.0 — a FLOOR trigger manufactured out of a coin that
 *     merely graduated. `isComplete()` is therefore a structural fact the lane must read
 *     before it reads a price, exactly the ordering spec §2.5 puts GONE and FAULT above
 *     FLOOR for.
 *
 *  5. 115,005,360,585 − 30,000,000,000 = 85,005,360,585. The repo's own hand-worked
 *     fixture (test-pumpfun-curve.mjs, and the header of src/data/pumpfun-live.js) says a
 *     standard curve graduates at 85.005 SOL. That number fell out of an account this
 *     file decoded, from a completely different direction, to five decimal places. It is
 *     the strongest single piece of evidence that these offsets are right, and it is why
 *     test-snipe-venue-pumpfun.mjs re-derives it rather than asserting a constant.
 *
 *  6. THE INSTRUCTION NAMES ARE NOT WHAT AN IDL READER WOULD GUESS — AND THIS IS THE
 *     WHOLE REASON buyIx REFUSES. The live program no longer executes `buy`/`sell`/
 *     `create` on new launches; it executes CreateV2 / BuyV2 / SellV2. Measured:
 *       sha256("global:buy")    = 66063d1201daebea   ← CORRECTED BELOW; this line said
 *                                                     "appears in NO transaction sampled"
 *       sha256("global:buy_v2") = b817ee6167c5d33d   ← the real BuyV2 instruction
 *       sha256("global:sell_v2")= 5df6823ce7e940b2   ← the real SellV2 instruction
 *
 *     CORRECTION, 2026-09-11, measured over 414 mainnet transactions from the public
 *     endpoint (fixtures/pumpfun-layout.json). The claim that legacy `buy` appears in no
 *     sampled transaction is FALSE, and backwards: 66063d1201daebea is the MOST COMMON
 *     pump.fun trade instruction on the tape — 106 samples against BuyV2's 4. Both paths
 *     are live simultaneously, legacy at 18 accounts and V2 at 27. Two more are also live:
 *     BuyExactSolIn (38fc74089edfcd5f, 18 accounts) and BuyExactQuoteInV2
 *     (c2ab1c46684d5b2f, 27), and the second takes (quoteIn, minBaseOut) — the OPPOSITE
 *     argument order to buy_v2's (amount, maxSolCost). Four encodings, two argument
 *     orders, and picking the wrong pair is not a refusal, it is a signed transaction.
 *
 *     The original point survives the correction and is strengthened by it: an adapter
 *     written from the obvious IDL name would emit the wrong bytes. And the far worse half
 *     is that the
 *     ARGUMENT encoding is the easy part: the real BuyV2 carries 27 accounts and SellV2
 *     carries 26, in an order nothing in this repo has verified. A transposed account in
 *     a hand-built buy does not refuse — it signs, it lands, and the money goes somewhere
 *     nobody planned. So: `layoutVerified: false`, and the encoders throw.
 *
 *     WHAT A PROVER STILL NEEDS, after the 2026-09-11 measurement. The account ORDER is
 *     now known and stable across independent transactions on all four instructions, and
 *     every derivable position was derived and matched: the bonding-curve PDA, global,
 *     __event_authority, global_volume_accumulator, user_volume_accumulator, creator-vault
 *     and fee_config all reproduce from seeds, 100%. THREE positions still cannot be
 *     computed from a mint and a signer, and three is enough to make an encoder
 *     impossible rather than merely unreviewed:
 *       · Buy index 16 / Sell index 14 — read-only, roughly 1:1 with the signer, off
 *         curve, and the two that were fetched DO NOT EXIST on chain. No seed combination
 *         tried reproduced it.
 *       · V2 index 18 — read-only, 1:1 with the MINT. Not derivable.
 *       · the secondary fee vault (Buy 17 / Sell 15 / V2 8) — fee-program-owned, 208
 *         bytes, takes real lamports, and eight distinct values rotate with no rule found.
 *     Also unresolved: legacy instruction data is NOT a fixed 24 bytes (24, 25+00, 25+01
 *     and 26+0101 were all observed), and the 26-byte Sell form carries a SEVENTEENTH
 *     account — userVolumeAccumulator inserted at index 14, shifting everything after it.
 *     Full evidence, with signatures and slots, in fixtures/pumpfun-layout.json.
 *
 *  7. THE FEE IS NOT A CONSTANT AND THE GLOBAL ACCOUNT IS NOT THE EXECUTABLE RATE.
 *     Inside a real BuyV2 the program CPIs into a SEPARATE fee program,
 *     pfeeUxB6jkeY1Hxd7CsFCAjcbHA9rWtchMGdZ6VojVZ, whose `GetFeesWithQuoteMint` returned
 *     three u64s [0, 95, 30]. The Global account's own static fee field reads 95 and the
 *     field after it reads 5 — and the tape says 30. Whatever that second static field
 *     means, IT IS NOT THE RATE THE SWAP CHARGED. A fee baked in here as a constant would
 *     have been wrong by 25 bps on the very first trade this file was written against.
 *     Hence: `feeBps` is NEVER defaulted. A curve decoded without one carries
 *     `feeBps: null`, and every quoting method REFUSES rather than quoting at zero — a
 *     zero fee flatters the mark, which is precisely the direction that turns a bad fill
 *     into a number that looks like a good one.
 *
 *  8. THE FEE SHAPE, MEASURED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS FROM REAL TRADE EVENTS.
 *     BUY  (tx 3X3mQJn8…, slot 446,023,102): solAmount 987,500,000 into the curve, fee
 *       9,381,250 (= 95.000 bps of it) and creatorFee 2,962,500 (= 30.000 bps of it)
 *       charged ON TOP; the user paid 999,843,750 and the virtual SOL reserve moved by
 *       the full 987,500,000.
 *     SELL (tx 3gzecTLyyW7…, slot 446,023,240): solAmount 342,232,518 out of the curve,
 *       fee 3,251,209 (95 bps) and creatorFee 1,026,698 (30 bps) taken OUT of it.
 *     One rule explains both: THE CURVE ALWAYS SEES THE GROSS; the fee is charged on the
 *     gross, outside the invariant, in whichever direction the quote asset is moving.
 *     snipe-curve.mjs's generic helpers model a fee taken off the input, which is a
 *     different arithmetic by ~12 parts per 100,000 at live size, so this adapter applies
 *     pump.fun's own shape and hands the helpers `feeBps: 0`. It is the venue's fee, and
 *     the venue adapter is where a venue's fee shape belongs.
 *
 *  9. AND THE ARITHMETIC ITSELF CHECKS OUT ON A REAL FILL. That same buy, replayed
 *     through the plain constant product on the reserves the event reports it started
 *     from:  floor(1,073,000,000,000,000 × 987,500,000 / (30,000,000,000 + 987,500,000))
 *     = 34,194,029,850,746 — EXACTLY the tokenAmount the chain delivered, to the raw
 *     unit. That is a known answer produced by somebody else's program, and the test
 *     re-runs it through snipe-curve.mjs's own exact-in helper.
 *
 * 10. NEW PUMP.FUN MINTS ARE TOKEN-2022. The CreateV2 transaction initialises the mint
 *     under TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb with MetadataPointer (18) and
 *     TokenMetadata (19) — both already in token2022.mjs ALLOWED_MINT_EXTENSIONS — and
 *     revokes mint and freeze authority. So spec gate 11 (`mint_refused`) passes a
 *     stock launch rather than refusing every one of them, and that was checked by
 *     running the executor's own auditMintAccount over the real mint bytes, not by
 *     reading the allow-list and hoping. `accountsFor()` therefore returns the mint
 *     account alongside the curve, so one getMultipleAccounts feeds gate 7 and gate 11.
 *
 * ══ WHAT THIS FILE STILL DOES NOT KNOW, SAID OUT LOUD ═════════════════════════════════
 *
 *  · THE INSTRUCTION ACCOUNT ORDER. 27 accounts for BuyV2, 26 for SellV2, order unproved.
 *    This is the one that keeps `layoutVerified` false.
 *  · BYTES 81..123 OF THE CURVE ACCOUNT. The live account is 124 bytes and only the first
 *    81 are accounted for. The remainder decoded to `01 01` and then 41 zeros, which is
 *    consistent with several different field lists and proof of none of them. Nothing
 *    here reads past offset 81, and nothing here asserts a total length — a program that
 *    grows its account must not turn into a decode failure on a position the bot holds.
 *  · ANYTHING IN THE GLOBAL ACCOUNT PAST OFFSET 113. See §7: the field at 154 reads 5
 *    while the tape charged 30, so the rest of that account is decoded by nobody here.
 *  · WHETHER A V2 CURVE CAN BE QUOTED IN A MINT OTHER THAN SOL. The fee program's entry
 *    point is literally named `GetFeesWithQuoteMint`, which is at least a hint that the
 *    quote asset is a parameter somewhere. Every curve sampled was SOL-quoted and the
 *    adapter declares SOL; if that ever stops being true the declaration is wrong and the
 *    oracle clause in snipe-venue.mjs is the thing that has to catch it. Recorded here so
 *    the next person does not have to rediscover the question.
 *  · TRADE EVENTS CARRY A `creator` FIELD THAT DISAGREED WITH THE CURVE'S. On the sampled
 *    sell it read EB9GaRfKcVuTKsNdmrfVzbSvyQr3es7o39bGBrzs1do7 while the curve account's
 *    creator for that mint is 8tEh5ZzrxyLh12jfprebQEVjz9kgMgUcYLCHmeSME6E9. The fee
 *    arithmetic around it decodes exactly, so the offsets are right and the DISAGREEMENT
 *    IS REAL. The CREATOR-SOLD trigger (spec §2.5 #5) must therefore take the deployer
 *    from the CURVE ACCOUNT, which is the field proved against the feed, and treat the
 *    event's creator as unattributed. `decodeTradeEvent` returns it flagged as such.
 *
 * ══ SHAPE ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Decoding is pure: no clock, no randomness, no network, no mutation of the buffer it is
 * handed, BigInt for every on-chain amount. The only method that touches the network is
 * `watch()`, and it does not open a connection — it is handed one, so nothing here can
 * dial out by being imported. No keypair is loaded on any path in this file; there is no
 * code here that could sign if it wanted to.

/* ══ THE V2 ENCODER ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * buy_v2 and sell_v2 ONLY. Legacy buy stays refused, and the reason is measured rather
 * than cautious: across 120 mainnet samples the deployed program is handed 18 accounts
 * where the IDL declares 16, and index 16 could not be named — 47 distinct values, none
 * reproduced by ~200k tested (program, seed) combinations. An encoder cannot be written
 * for an account nobody can compute, and "probably optional" is not a thing to sign.
 *
 * WHAT PROVED V2, and what it would take to un-prove it: 13 independent buy_v2 and 17
 * sell_v2 occurrences, distinct signers and mints, SOL-quoted and not. Every one carried
 * exactly the IDL's account count in exactly the IDL's order with exactly 24 bytes of
 * data. Every position derived from (mint, signer, on-chain state). The account lists and
 * the raw bytes are in fixtures/pumpfun-verify-buy_v2.json and -sell_v2.json, and
 * test-snipe-venue-pumpfun.mjs re-encodes each one and asserts byte-for-byte equality
 * with what the chain actually accepted. That is the round trip the venue contract asks
 * for, and it is why layoutVerified can be true without anybody taking anyone's word.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THIS ENCODER REFUSES, each a way to lose money without an error:
 *
 *  1. A STALE CREATOR. creator_vault is PDA(["creator-vault", BondingCurve.creator]), and
 *     the creator is MUTABLE: migrate_bonding_curve_creator rewrites it. Measured on
 *     mainnet — mint DNLwPEp8… had its creator rewritten at slot 446099886, ONE SLOT after
 *     the curve was created, which is precisely a sniper's window. A vault derived from a
 *     creator read a moment too early is a valid pubkey pointing at the wrong account. So
 *     the caller must state the slot the curve was read at, and it must not trail the slot
 *     being built for.
 *  2. A FEE RECIPIENT THAT IS NOT A MEMBER. fee_recipient and buyback_fee_recipient are
 *     not derivable — they are a CHOICE from sets the Global account holds (16 and 8
 *     respectively; the program rejects a non-member with error 6057). Checked here so the
 *     refusal names the reason instead of arriving as an opaque failed transaction.
 *  3. A DESTINATION THAT IS NOT THE SIGNER'S. Proven on chain: two top-level buys paid
 *     from one wallet and delivered the tokens to accounts owned by two OTHER wallets,
 *     with no error. The program does not enforce it, so the position can be handed away
 *     silently. This does, before signing.
 */

 *
 * This comment used to say the way to flip it is to prove the instruction account order
 * against a real transaction, not to edit the line. That is what happened. The proof is
 * thirty real mainnet occurrences — 13 buy_v2 and 17 sell_v2, distinct signers, distinct
 * mints, SOL-quoted and not — kept with their full account lists in
 * fixtures/pumpfun-v2-encode-cases.json. test-snipe-venue-pumpfun.mjs re-encodes every one
 * from (mint, signer, on-chain state) and asserts the produced account list equals, index
 * by index, what the chain actually accepted. 30 of 30. The layout is not believed; it is
 * reproduced on every test run, and a drift breaks the build rather than a wallet.
 *
 * THE SCOPE IS V2 ONLY, and the exclusion is measured rather than cautious. Legacy `buy`
 * is handed 18 accounts where the IDL declares 16, and across 120 samples index 16 could
 * not be named: 47 distinct values, none reproduced by roughly 200,000 tested (program,
 * seed) combinations. buyIx and sellIx emit buy_v2 and sell_v2. Nothing emits legacy buy,
 * because an account nobody can compute is not an account anyone should sign for.
 *
 * The quote asset is declared as WSOL. pump.fun's curve holds native lamports, but WSOL is
 * this repo's canonical id for the nine-decimal SOL every cap and the Pyth oracle are
 * already denominated in (jupiter.mjs uses it the same way), and naming it is what makes
 * the contract's `quote_mint_mismatch` clause able to check us at all.
