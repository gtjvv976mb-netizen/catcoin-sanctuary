/**
 * THE RISK ENGINE — pure decision logic for the Claude Company executor.
 *
 * Deliberately free of network, wallet and clock: every input is passed in and
 * every output is a plain intent ({action, reason, ...}). That is what makes it
 * simulatable — simulate.mjs runs this exact code over tens of thousands of
 * synthetic price paths, so the numbers you see are produced by the same
 * function shared with the server and executor, not by a separate toy model.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ENGINE DECIDES, and what it deliberately no longer decides:
 *   ENTRY SIZING — risk-at-stop, the Kelly rails, the fee floors, the book heat and
 *   the two portfolio brakes (DAILY LOSS LIMIT and MAX CONCURRENT POSITIONS) that
 *   decide whether a bot survives a bad week. All of that is still here, untouched.
 *
 *   EXITS — none of its own. Until desk-led-v4 (2026-09-05) this file ran a full
 *   bracket on every held position: a local stop, a 1.35x breakeven and 1.5x/25%
 *   trail ratchet, a 2x take-profit, the authored target, a band clock and an age
 *   exit, each on the bot's OWN ruler (a chain-simulated Jupiter sell quote against
 *   its own fill) and the bot's OWN clock (every poll, two witnesses). The desk ran
 *   the same policy on ITS ruler (DexScreener consensus vs entry_ref) and ITS clock.
 *   Two engines that agree on levels and disagree on moments: Shrek, call 55 — the
 *   bot sold 03:01:42Z on its own normalised stop at -13.5%; the desk's determined
 *   stop_hit came 03:10:24Z, and the desk's exit row arrived to a position that no
 *   longer existed. The owner's rule is verbatim: "all exits should be followed not
 *   after or before, but as exactly as it was determined."
 *
 *   So stepPosition HOLDS unless the desk has published an exit for this call, and
 *   then it sells everything (DESK EXIT — the desk knows things the price alone does
 *   not: creator sold, LP pulled, thesis dead). The pure pricePolicy still exists in
 *   trade-policy.mjs, shared byte-for-byte with the desk's evaluateExit; the bot runs
 *   it only in MIRROR mode (executor/desk-mirror.mjs) when the desk has been
 *   unreachable for DESK_UNREACHABLE_MS, on the desk's absolute levels with the
 *   desk's ruler, so that the determination is still the desk's even when the desk
 *   cannot speak.
 *
 * None of this manufactures an edge — the edge is the quality of the desk's
 * calls. This engine exists so a real edge is not destroyed by one bad night,
 * and so a bad streak cannot compound into a blown account.

/** How the bot decides WHETHER to buy a published call.
