/* POPCAT'S FILE: every cat coin it checked, and its picks, as the floor will show them.

   Popcat, the agency's callout bot, reads new pump.fun coins, keeps the cat ones, runs twelve
   on-chain checks on each and writes EVERY coin it checked to site/assets/callouts.json, with
   every check and what it found. A coin in which no check found a red flag is a CALLOUT ("no
   red flags found"). A coin one or more checks flagged is SPOTTED, not called out: its red flags
   are named in plain words. Either way it is a list of checks, never advice. Every six hours
   Popcat also makes at most one PICK: a callout, with a short draft the agency may post BY HAND
   on pump.fun (the README says why a bot may not). The agency never holds, buys or sells a coin
   it calls out, and Popcat never lists a coin CashCat launched.

     { "callouts": [ {                          every coin checked, newest first, at most MAX_CALLOUTS
