/**
 * BUILD THE EXTENSION: the Cat Intelligence Agency extension, with CoinMarketCat, Snipurr,
 * Popcat, CashCat and Crying Cat inside.
 *
 * Six bundles (the worker, the console relay, the injected Phantom bridge, the popup,
 * the options page and the first-run setup page), one manifest, three icons, the five cats'
 * sprites and CashCat's logo art and font, into ./dist — the folder Chrome loads unpacked.
 * The point of this file is the plugin, not the entry list:
 *
 *   · the engine imports the executor's snipe modules from vendor/executor/, copied
 *     verbatim from a named commit of Claude-Company by scripts/sync-executor.mjs and
 *     hashed in PROVENANCE.json, so the browser runs THE SAME entry contract, curve
 *     arithmetic, buy_v2/sell_v2 encoders and exit determiner WALL-ST-E runs. What
 *     this bot refuses is decided upstream and synced, never edited here.
 *   · two imports in that closure are Node-only. `node:crypto` (token2022's digest)
 *     is redirected to src/shims/node-crypto.mjs; `./jupiter.mjs` (which pulls the
 *     SQLite journal) is redirected to src/shims/jupiter.mjs. Any OTHER `node:` import
 *     that ever creeps into the closure fails the build by name, rather than shipping
 *     a bundle that throws at first use.
 *   · @solana/web3.js, bs58, buffer and @noble/hashes resolve from this repository's
 *     node_modules, pinned to the executor's exact versions, so one copy of web3.js
 *     exists in every bundle and a PublicKey made in one module is a PublicKey in another.
 *
 * Usage: node build.mjs [--watch]   (after `npm ci`)
